        <p>Dataview is an incredibly powerful plugin that allows you to filter data in your obsidian vault in a lot of really cool ways. In this post, I’m going to show you how I use it to create a table of book ratings from YAML metadata.</p>
<p>Dont’ worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds. Here’s a post that walks you through the whole process.</p>
<h2 id="How-Dataview-works"><a href="#How-Dataview-works" class="headerlink" title="How Dataview works"></a>How Dataview works</h2><p>The best way to explain the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">Dataview plugin</a> is to show an example. One of the ways I use it is to create a table of all of the ratings from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bookworm.fm/">Bookworm podcast</a> that I do with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thesweetsetup.com/how-joe-buhligs-shabbat-helps-him-stay-intentional/">Joe Buhlig</a>. We read a book every two weeks, we talk about what we got out of it, and we give the book a rating. And using Dataview, I can compile all of the ratings into a table.</p>
<p>So to start, I have a note in my Obsidian Vault for every single episode of bookworm. To add the rating, I simply add the YAML frontmatter metadata in Edit Mode like so:</p>
<pre><code>---
(your YAML text)
---
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s what it looks like side-by-side in Edit Mode and Preview Mode:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview1.jpg"></p>
<p>In this particular example, I have a 3 pieces of metadata:</p>
<ol>
<li>The tag <em>bookworm</em></li>
<li>Joe’s Rating (4.0)</li>
<li>My rating (4.0)</li>
</ol>
<p>(In the podcast, we rate books from one to five stars, similar to the Amazon ratings. So this particular book, Joe gave it a 4 stars, and I gave it a 4 stars.)</p>
<p>Now from this point, we’re going to create a new note and use the Dataview plugin to create a table of all of these ratings in the new note. So the first thing we need to do is to install the Dataview plugin.</p>
<p>To install the plugin, click the Gear to access the Settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview2.jpg"></p>
<p>Then go to <em>Community Plugins</em> and click <em>Browse</em>:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview3.jpg"></p>
<p>Search the Dataview plugin. Once you find it, click <em>Install</em> and then <em>Enable</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview4.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that in the plugin description, they give you a lot of other examples on how you might want to use this.</p>
<p>Now we can close the Settings and go back to our new note, <em>Bookworm Ratings</em>, and add the following code:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">table Joe, Mike</span><br><span class="line">from &quot;Bookworm&quot;</span><br><span class="line">sort Mike desc</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The three backticks are the Obsidian formatting for code snippets, and everything inside is telling the Dataview plugin what to do. Here’s a description of what’s going on here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dataview</code> tells Obsidian to use the Dataview plugin</li>
<li>table Joe, Mike tells Dataview to create a table with values from Joe &amp; Mike from the YAML section of the desired files</li>
<li>from “Bookworm” tell Dataview to include all files from the <em>Bookworm</em> folder</li>
<li>sort Mike desc says to sort everything in descending order by the values in the Mike column</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all we have to do. Now when we click the Preview button, Dataview will render a table of ratings based on the values in the YAML metadata. Here’s a side-by-side screenshot of the code in Edit Mode and the table in Preview Mode:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dataview5.jpg"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how you might use this incredible plugin. There are lots of other great examples over at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataview-plugin-snippet-showcase/13673">Obdisian forum</a> if you need some additional inspiration.</p>

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Templates in Obsidian are a great way to jumpstart creating a new note. In this post, we’re going to show you how to set up and use a couple different types of templates in Obsidian. If you’d like to see it in action, here’s a short video from our upcoming PKM course.</p>
<h2 id="Daily-Notes-Templates"><a href="#Daily-Notes-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Daily Notes Templates"></a>Daily Notes Templates</h2><p>The first type of template is a <em>Daily Notes template</em>. This is my daily notes template:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates1.jpg"></p>
<p>This is just a note in my Obsidian library. To use use a note like this as your daily notes template, go to the <em>Settings –&gt; Core Plugins</em> and make sure that the <em>Daily Notes</em> plugin is activated.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates2.jpg"></p>
<p>Once activated, configure the settings for the Daily Notes plugin and make sure you have both the new file location set and the template file location. For example, my template file location is <em>Templates&#x2F;Daily Notes Template</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates3.jpg"></p>
<p>Now when we click the button to create a new Daily Note, it pre-populates the new note with our templated text:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates4.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="General-Templates"><a href="#General-Templates" class="headerlink" title="General Templates"></a>General Templates</h2><p>In addition to the Daily Notes template, you can use templates anywhere in Obsidian when creating a new note by activating the <em>Templates</em> core plugin. Go to <em>Settings –&gt; Core Plugins</em> and make sure that the <em>Templates</em> plugin is activated as well as the <em>Command Palette</em> plugin (what you’ll use to insert the templates).</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates5.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, go to the settings for the <em>Templates</em> plugin and set the folder that will contain your templates (mine is set to the <em>Templates</em> folder). Once you have your template files created, you can insert a template into a new note by opening the Command Palette with <em>Command-P</em> and selecting <em>Insert Template</em> (you can also use the keyboard shortcut <em>Command-T</em>).</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/templates6.jpg"></p>
<p>Choose the template file you want to open, and the text from the template file gets inserted into your new note.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>When I first started using Obsidian, I expected it would help me make connections between my notes and inspire new ideas. But over the last 12 months I’ve been using the app, I have also fallen in love with it as a writing tool. In fact, <em>I have written every article I’ve published in 2021 in Obsidian.</em></p>
<p>In this post, I want to share a few tweaks that make Obsidian my perfect writing app.</p>
<h2 id="My-Journey-Away-from-Ulysses"><a href="#My-Journey-Away-from-Ulysses" class="headerlink" title="My Journey Away from Ulysses"></a>My Journey Away from Ulysses</h2><p>Let me get this out right now: <em>Ulysses is an incredible writing app</em>.</p>
<p>It’s just not for me for a couple specific reasons.</p>
<p>First, publishing to the web isn’t quite as easy as it should be with Ulysses. It does give you the ability to publish straight to Wordpress, and you can even update blog posts from Ulysses now - if you can get it to connect to your custom Wordpress blog.</p>
<p>When this broke for me, I started digging in to how to fix it and quickly came across weird plugins and settings for modifying XMLRPC. And unfortunately, I could never get it functioning again. I fully understand it’s something on my domains, but the “simple instructions” didn’t work and even as a web developer I didn’t feel comfortable digging too far into this.</p>
<p>Which meant I was stuck copying and pasting into Wordpress. And because Ulysses doesn’t use standard Markdown, that meant I had to “export” my text first. Which works, but adds a few extra clicks or taps in order to get my text. Combine that with the fact that Ulysses has some weird Markdown formatting that never quite clicked for me in the first place, and I was left looking for a straight Markdown-based text editor.</p>
<p>Obsidian fits that description perfectly. It’s simple, uses plain text files, provides inline formatting, and supports standard Markdown formatting. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a plain text editor.</p>
<p>But there are a few additional settings and plugins you can use to make it even better as a writing app.</p>
<h2 id="Obsidian-Settings"><a href="#Obsidian-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Obsidian Settings"></a>Obsidian Settings</h2><p>First, let’s look at some of the settings.</p>
<p>To access these settings, click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner and then select <em>Editor</em> from the Settings sidebar.</p>
<p>The defaults are actually pretty good, but here’s the key settings you want if you’re going to use Obsidian for writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that <strong>Auto pair Markdown syntax</strong> is toggled <strong>ON</strong>. This creates both symbol and places the cursor in the middle, making it easier to create italicized or emphasized text.</li>
<li>Make sure <strong>Smart indent lists</strong> is toggled <strong>ON</strong>. This makes it easier to create bulleted and numbered lists quickly, automatically adding the next bullet when you hit the <em>Return</em> key.</li>
<li>Make sure that <strong>Fold heading</strong> and <strong>Fold indent</strong> are toggled <strong>ON</strong>. This creates carats for Markdown headers as well as indented text, adding some cool outliner-inspired features that make it easy to fold up text in large files and focus on the text you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a bunch of other settings you can customize, but may of them are simply personal preference. These are the important ones.</p>
<p>Once you have your settings, it’s time to move on to the plugins.</p>
<h2 id="Obsidian-Core-Plugin-Settings"><a href="#Obsidian-Core-Plugin-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Obsidian Core Plugin Settings"></a>Obsidian Core Plugin Settings</h2><p>There are two types of plugins in Obsidian: <em>Core plugins</em> that ship with the app, and <em>Community plugins</em> that you can install to extend the functionality of Obsidian. We’re going to look at the Core plugins first.</p>
<p>Here are my recommendations for modifying the Core plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that <strong>Backlinks</strong> and <strong>Outgoing Links</strong> are both toggled <strong>ON</strong>. These are sections available in the right sidebar that show all of the notes that link to the active note and all of the notes linked to from the active note respectively. (If you’re new to the concept of connected notes, check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thesweetsetup.com/the-power-of-obsidians-local-graph/">this article on using the local graph</a>.)</li>
<li>Make sure that <strong>Outline</strong> is toggled <strong>ON</strong>. This adds a tab in the right sidebar that creates a table of contents for your note based on the Markdown headers. This is helpful when you need to jump to a specific section of a longer text as you can do so simply by clicking on the appropriate header title.</li>
<li>Turn the<strong>Word Count</strong> setting <strong>OFF</strong>. Word counts are important, but there’s a Community plugin that does this <em>much</em> better than the built-in word count tool here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there are a bunch of options here that are personal preference but these are the important ones. Once you have these Core plugins set, it’s time to add some Community plugins.</p>
<h2 id="Obsidian-Community-Plugins-for-an-Upgraded-Writing-Experience"><a href="#Obsidian-Community-Plugins-for-an-Upgraded-Writing-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Obsidian Community Plugins for an Upgraded Writing Experience"></a>Obsidian Community Plugins for an Upgraded Writing Experience</h2><p>You can access the Community plugins public directory by going to <em>Settings –&gt; Community plugins –&gt; Browse</em> once you’ve toggled off <em>Safe Mode</em>. From there, you can find plugins for just about anything, from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thesweetsetup.com/syncing-embedding-tasks-from-todoist-in-obsidian/">embedding tasks from Todoist</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thesweetsetup.com/timeblocking-in-obsidian/">creating timeblocked daily plans</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thesweetsetup.com/my-obsidian-based-kanban-writing-workflow/">creating kanban boards</a> - all based off plain text files using standard Markdown.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/communityplugins.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that many of the plugins I will share here are replacements for standard features in Ulysses, so if you don’t mind non-standard Markdown formatting and don’t run into the publishing issues that I did maybe try that instead. But if you’re all in with Obsidian, here are the plugins I use to make Obsidian my perfect writing app.</p>
<h3 id="Better-Word-Count"><a href="#Better-Word-Count" class="headerlink" title="Better Word Count"></a>Better Word Count</h3><p>The first plugin is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count">Better Word Count</a>. This replaces the built-in word count core plugin, but adds a few more options and features (for example, the ability to add the daily words written).</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/betterwordcount.jpg"></p>
<p>Here are the settings I recommend for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that <strong>Collect Statistics</strong> is toggled <strong>ON</strong>. This is required for the daily word count statistic.</li>
<li>Turn <strong>Select a Preset</strong> to <strong>Custom</strong>. This allows you to create your own stats formatting in the status bar. I use <code>w: &#123;word_count&#125; c: &#123;character_count&#125; dw: &#123;words_today&#125;</code> which gives me the words and characters in the current document, plus the total words written today.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that you may need to force reload Obsidian before the stats show up in your status bar. You can do this by quitting and reopening the app or selecting <em>View –&gt; Force Reload</em>.)</p>
<p>It’s not as good as the writing stats in Ulysses, but it’s good enough for me.</p>
<h3 id="Reading-Time"><a href="#Reading-Time" class="headerlink" title="Reading Time"></a>Reading Time</h3><p>Another handy Ulysses feature is being able to see how long it will take to read the text in the selected file. But you can add this feature to the status bar using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/avr/obsidian-reading-time">Reading Time</a> plugin.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readingtime.jpg"></p>
<p>This one is pretty straightforward - just install it and turn it on and you’ll see the reading time at the bottom of your Obsidian window. You can customize your reading speed however in the settings for the plugin.</p>
<h3 id="Footnote-Shortcut"><a href="#Footnote-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="Footnote Shortcut"></a>Footnote Shortcut</h3><p>If you use footnotes a lot, they can be a bit of a pain to create via standard Markdown. But it’s a lot easier with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/akaalias/obsidian-footnotes">Obsidian Footnotes</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Once installed, you can a command and hotkey is added for <em>Footnote Shortcut: Insert and Navigate Footnote</em>. You can customize the hotkey by going to <em>Settings –&gt; Hotkey</em> and searching for <em>Footnote</em>, which will then insert the appropriate Markdown and navigate to the bottom of the note where you can insert the text for your footnote.</p>
<h3 id="Focus-Mode"><a href="#Focus-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Focus Mode"></a>Focus Mode</h3><p>The Obsidian interface can be a little distracting when you’re trying to focus on your words. Fortunately, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-focus-mode">Focus Mode</a> plugin allows you to remove all the distractions and focus on what you’re writing.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/focusmode.jpg"></p>
<p>Once the plugin is installed and active, just click the <em>Toggle Focus Mode</em> button to hide the sidebars and status bar, and you can shift-click the button to hide everything but the active writing pane.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>There’s a bit of a note-taking revolution happening, and at the epicenter is a concept called <em>bidirectional linking</em>. It’s a fundamentally different approach to linked notes in that the link only needs to exist on one of the notes is order for the connection to be active from both directions. For example, let’s say I have a link from <em>Note 1</em> to <em>Note 2</em>. In the past, I would be able to travel from <em>Note 1</em> to <em>Note 2</em> by clicking on the link, but I wouldn’t be able to get back without a separate link from <em>Note 2</em> to <em>Note 1</em>. <em>Bidirectional linking</em> solves this by providing a two-way link between notes, even if there is only a single link between them.</p>
<p>This idea has been incorporated by a bunch of popular note-taking apps lately. Roam Research, Craft, and my beloved Obsidian are just a few of the apps that have implemented some version of bidirectional linking. But what makes Obsidian unique (and appealing to Mac nerds like me) is that it simply sits on top of Markdown-formatted plain text files.</p>
<p>It also offers a lot of customization through plugins that you can use to extend the capabilities of the application. These plugins allow you to turn Obsidian into a digital Bullet Journal, the ultimate writing app, or even a kanban board for project management. Just click a button and you can install a third-party plugin that significantly alters what Obsidian is capable of.</p>
<p>The magic happens in Obsidian as a result of the combination of these three features (bidirectional linking, Markdown-formatted text files, and third-party plugin support). While this appeared feasible on the desktop, being able to combine all of these in an App Store approved iOS app seemed like an impossible task.</p>
<p>But just a few short weeks ago, Obsidian released an official iOS app through the App Store. And it includes everything that makes Obsidian great.</p>
<h2 id="The-Interface"><a href="#The-Interface" class="headerlink" title="The Interface"></a>The Interface</h2><p>Getting the entire Obsidian interface onto the small screen of an iPhone is no small feat. For example, the main Obsidian interface has three section:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left sidebar, which includes the File Explorer and Search</li>
<li>The main Editor window</li>
<li>The right sidebar (which includes backlinks, tags, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And it’s all there on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Both of the sidebars are available via swipe gestures , giving you access to the entire Obsidian interface without cluttering up your iPhone screen.</p>
<h2 id="The-Features"><a href="#The-Features" class="headerlink" title="The Features"></a>The Features</h2><p><em>ALL</em> of the features of Obsidian on the desktop are here, and it’s kind of incredible when you think about it. The Graph View, Quick Switcher, keyboard shortcuts - everything. And not only is it all here, but it’s implemented in a way that makes sense on a smaller touch interface. For example, there’s a feature on iOS called <em>Quick Action</em> that is activated by swiping down anywhere on the screen (except the top of your device, which opens Notifications or Control Center). You can assign this to any action you want, but by default it opens the Command Palette - which feels only natural since it’s kind of Spotlight for Obsidian and the swipe gesture is the same one you use to access Spotlight from the Home Screen.</p>
<p>There’s also a mobile toolbar above the onscreen keyboard that gives you access to many common actions. These can not only help you do things quickly in the app but also serve as a great Markdown reference tool. If you’re coming from an app like Evernote and haven’t written in plain text before, this is a wonderful security blanket.</p>
<h2 id="The-Plugins"><a href="#The-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="The Plugins"></a>The Plugins</h2><p>Even the community plugins are here, though there is a caveat - not every community plugin will work (or work correctly) on the mobile version. The plugin developers may have to add or modify code to make their plugins work correctly, so if you have 30 community plugins installed don’t expect them all to work flawlessly right away. A good number of them will, but I’ve encountered a few that I rely on which still need some TLC.</p>
<h2 id="Sync"><a href="#Sync" class="headerlink" title="Sync"></a>Sync</h2><p>This is one of the most interesting things about the iOS app.</p>
<p>Obsidian is actually a completely free app for both macOS and iOS. The pricing model is based on two premium core plugins, one of which is <em>Sync</em>. The service from Obsidian is currently $4 USD per month, and offers end-to-end encryption and 1 year of revision history.</p>
<p>But, remember, Obsidian simply sits on top of plain text files. So when you open up the iOS app for the first time, you’re prompted to create a vault inside of your Obsidian folder on iCloud Drive. For example, if you create a vault on Obsidian for iOS called “Notes” it will live in <code>iCloud Drive\Obsidian\Notes</code> on your Mac. This allows you to sync all of your files via iCloud Drive, and even opens up some interesting automation possibilities with Shortcuts and the Files app.</p>
<p>That means that you can get it all - bidirectional linking, Markdown-based text files, plugins, even sync - for free.</p>
<p>Which means there really is no reason not to give connected note-taking a try.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thesweetsetup.com/obsidian/">Obsidian</a> is a great place to practice time blocking because you can link your time-blocked schedule to your daily note. In this video, we’re going to walk you through how to set up time blocking in Obsidian using the <em>Daily Notes</em> Core plugin, and the <em>Day Planner</em> Community plugin.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is click the gear icon in the left sidebar to access the <em>Settings</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner1.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, go to <strong>Core Plugins</strong> and make sure that the <em>Daily Notes</em> plugin is enabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner2.jpg"></p>
<p>Once the <em>Daily Notes</em> plugin is enabled, you’ll see an additional icon in the left sidebar. Click on this icon to either create or open today’s Daily Note. For example, this is the daily note for August 9, 2021.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner3.jpg"></p>
<p>This is a great place to capture any sort of information that we want to associate with today’s date, including ideas with tasks that we need to do. It’s also the perfect place to set our time blocked schedule using the <em>Day Planner</em> plugin.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-Day-Planner"><a href="#Setting-Up-Day-Planner" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up Day Planner"></a>Setting Up Day Planner</h2><p>Go back to the Settings menu and click <strong>Community Plugins</strong>, then click <strong>Browse</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner4.jpg"></p>
<p>From the Community Plugins directory, search for <em>Day Planner</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner5.jpg"></p>
<p>Click <strong>Install</strong> to install the plugin and <strong>Enable</strong> to turn it on.</p>
<p>Next, close the plugins directory. Go to installed plugins and make sure that the <em>Day Planner</em> plugin is toggled on.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner6.jpg"></p>
<p>Now <em>Day Planner</em> is ready to be used. By default, it keeps your day planner documents in a separate folder and we want to include these on our daily notes. So in the settings for the <em>Day Planner</em> plugin, change <em>File Mode</em> to <em>Command Mode</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner7.jpg"></p>
<p>Here are the other recommended settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete past planner items: ON</li>
<li>Mermaid Gantt: OFF</li>
<li>Status Bar - Circular Progress: ON</li>
<li>Status Bar - Now &amp; Next: ON</li>
<li>Task Notification: OFF</li>
<li>Task Zoom Level: LOW (all the way to the left)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we’re ready to use the day planner plugin.</p>
<h2 id="Using-Day-Planner"><a href="#Using-Day-Planner" class="headerlink" title="Using Day Planner"></a>Using Day Planner</h2><p>Go back to our daily notes and insert a <em>Day Planner</em> section by hitting <code>Command-P</code> to open up the <em>Command Palette</em>. Search for <code>Day Planner</code> and select the bottom option <em>Day Planner: Add a Day Planner template for today to the current note</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner8.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, plan out your day using 24 hour time formatting like so:</p>
<pre><code>- [ ] 07:00 Morning Routine
- [ ] 08:00 Meetings
- [ ] 10:00 TSS Admin
- [ ] 11:30 Weekly Standup
- [ ] 12:00 Lunch
- [ ] 13:00 Timeblocking Video
- [ ] 15:00 Writing
- [ ] 18:00 Soccer Practice
- [ ] 20:00 Dinner
</code></pre>
<p>In the Status Bar, we can see what we are working on right now: a circular chart indicating the progress of the current time block, and the next event on my time blocked plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner9.jpg"></p>
<p>We can also see a visualization of this by hitting <code>Command-P</code> to open up the <em>Command Palette</em> again and searching for <code>Day Planner</code>, then selecting <em>Show the Day Planner Timeline</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner10.jpg"></p>
<p>Once we do, the timeline opens in the right sidebar, giving us a visualization of our time blocked plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dayplanner11.jpg"></p>
<p>When we have <em>Track Current Time</em> toggled on, the red bar will automatically adjust to the current time showing me only the appropriate information as we go about our day.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The promise of apps like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> is to give you a tool for connected note-taking. (If you’re wondering which one is right for you, check out <a href="/demo/obsidian2hexo/p/a9223bed492b0d120a101fb86841301f6fb07610">Obsidian vs. Roam Research</a>). With this approach, you can see the commonalities between your thoughts as your notes bump up against one another, allowing you to see connections and discover new insights. These connections are usually represented in some sort of <em>Graph View</em>, which can look like a complex spiderweb of notes and ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graph.jpg"></p>
<p>It looks impressive, but in reality, it’s often kind of useless.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll show you how to leverage the <em>Local Graph</em> in Obsidian to navigate your notes. And if you prefer to watch, here’s a video.</p>
<p>[embed]<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/549340797[/embed]">https://vimeo.com/549340797[/embed]</a></p>
<h2 id="Note-Linking-amp-The-Graph-View"><a href="#Note-Linking-amp-The-Graph-View" class="headerlink" title="Note Linking &amp; The Graph View"></a>Note Linking &amp; The Graph View</h2><p>At the heart of the Graph View is the concept of note linking. By making connections between notes, you are saying that these two ideas or notes have something in common and belong together. The more ideas you link together, the more they impact one another and shape the eventual output — whether that be a blog post, podcast, video, or simply your developed thoughts on a topic.</p>
<p>Truth be told, your brain is doing this exact thing <em>all the time.</em> It’s really good at connecting the dots you collect and making new things out of them, but it may not feel natural at first.</p>
<p>I first stumbled on this idea in <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253/ref=nosim&tag=sweetsetup-20">Steal Like an Artist</a></em> by Austin Kleon. Before reading this book, I couldn’t describe myself as “creative.” I used to get frustrated because every time I tried to create, I’d eventually notice that my work ended up being heavily influenced by something I had read, seen, or heard somewhere else. I assumed that I just didn’t have the ability, the creative gene, to make anything inspired like so many of my internet heroes did.</p>
<p>But Austin Kleon helped me to realize that creativity is <em>not</em> coming up with something completely original. It’s simply remixing the things that you take in. In fact, nothing is completely original. When you create something, you are simply connecting the dots in ways that haven’t been connected before.</p>
<p>I decided that I wasn’t going to worry about judging the output anymore. I was simply going to do my best to collect new dots and let my brain connect them however it was inclined to do so. Whatever came out was simply the logical result of the dots I had collected. I had a formula for my creativity. I was going to improve my creative output by simply collecting better inputs.</p>
<p>What I love about the Graph View is that it allows you to visualize these connections that already exist in your brain. It also allows you to manipulate the dots and connect them in new and interesting ways. The more interesting dots you collect and connect, the more valuable the output — whether that be a blog post, a podcast episode, or simply a way of working through your thoughts on a particular topic.</p>
<p>At the heart of this graph view is the concept of <em>bidirectional linking</em>, which is actually a lot more than just a link from one page to another.</p>
<h2 id="Bidirectional-Linking-gt-Wiki-Style-Crosslinking"><a href="#Bidirectional-Linking-gt-Wiki-Style-Crosslinking" class="headerlink" title="Bidirectional Linking &gt; Wiki-Style Crosslinking"></a>Bidirectional Linking &gt; Wiki-Style Crosslinking</h2><p>Note that bidirectional linking is <em>not</em> the same as wiki-style linking, which many plain text apps like nvALT have supported for a long time. You use special characters (oftentimes double brackets, just like in Obsidian) to create a link to another page, but the important difference here is that the link only goes one direction.</p>
<p>As a basic example, let’s say you have a note that serves as a table of contents for a library of other notes. In this table of contents note are wiki-style crosslinks to a bunch of other notes. This allows you to navigate to your individual notes from the table of contents, but <em>not the other way around</em>. Yes, you have a link between the notes, but it’s only useful from a single direction. It’s like a one-way street in your brain. It’s fine if you always approach that note from a single direction, but it’s not great if you want the freedom to explore.</p>
<p>Yes, you can turn this into a two-way street by adding a link back to the original page, but it more than doubles the amount of work when adding a link if you want this kind of connection for every link you add:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to create the link from Note A to Note B</li>
<li>You have to open Note B and a link back to Note A</li>
<li>You have to go back to Note A and continue what you were doing</li>
</ol>
<p>This is too much friction for me personally. I find I forget to add the links back to the original note more often than I actually add them, which makes my sad, broken cross-reference library more frustrating than useful.</p>
<p>But this is solved with bidirectional links because the link back to the referring note gets added automatically.</p>
<p>With a bidirectional link, the relationship between the linked notes is visible in the <em>Linked Mentions</em> section of <strong>both</strong> notes. This gives you the freedom to follow your thoughts in either direction, and is visible not only in the big graph view in Obsidian but also the <em>Local Graph</em>.</p>
<p>And this, my friends, is where the magic happens.</p>
<h2 id="Using-The-Local-Graph-in-Obsidian"><a href="#Using-The-Local-Graph-in-Obsidian" class="headerlink" title="Using The Local Graph in Obsidian"></a>Using The Local Graph in Obsidian</h2><p>You can access the Local Graph in Obsidian by clicking <strong>More Options</strong> for a note (the three dots in the upper-right) and selecting <strong>Open Local Graph</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidianhome.jpg"></p>
<p>This opens a new pane displaying the Local Graph for the note. You can drag it into either the left or right sidebar (depending on your preference) so you can always see it, and it will automatically update as you select different notes. You can click on a new note from the <em>File Explorer</em> in the left sidebar, or you can click on one of the dots displayed in the Local Graph to jump straight to that note.</p>
<p>And this is where things start to get interesting.</p>
<p>If you make good connections between your notes, over time your vault turns into a choose your own adventure story. You can start at a specific place (i.e. your <em>Home</em> note), and navigate through your library using only the linked mentions displayed in the Local Graph.</p>
<p>For example, from my Home note, I may want to develop my general note on habits. I call this a <em>Map of Content</em> (or MOC, a term I picked up from Nick Milo of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI">Linking Your Thinking</a>), and it has a few of the things from other notes that I consider important as well as a few opinion notes about the topic. Clicking on the <em>MOC - Habits</em> link from my <em>home</em> note takes me to that note and updates the Local Graph instantaneously:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidianhabits.jpg"></p>
<p>From here, I may want to review my notes on the book <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=nosim&tag=sweetsetup-20">Atomic Habits</a></em> by James Clear. So clicking the <em>Atomic Habits</em> link takes me to that note, and again, the Local Graph is updated.</p>

<p>While perusing my notes from the book, I come across a concept known as <em>Goodhart’s Law</em>. This is a pretty important idea, so it actually has its own note that I can view from this page by again clicking the link.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/obsidiangoodhartslaw.jpg"></p>
<p>I’ve now gone several levels deep in landing on this idea that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. But what’s really powerful about this is that it works both ways. I could have started at my <em>Goodhart’s Law</em> note (maybe something reminded me of that note and I decided to look it up) and navigated my notes the other way as well.</p>
<p>The secret to making this work is to make <em>atomic notes</em>. The word atomic actually means “of or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.” So an atomic note is one that can’t be broken down any further, like my Goodhart’s Law note. By having a bunch of smaller notes in your library, you have the building blocks for connecting and creating in new and powerful ways.</p>
<p>If you’re used to keeping large notes and sorting them in folders, this can be a game-changer. Instead of having to drill down into your folder hierarchy or search for something specific, you can stumble upon the relevant information and jump across categories by using these bidirectional links to connect the atomic notes in your library. It does take a little more intentional effort when making notes, but the long-term payoff of being able to come at your ideas from multiple angles is worth it.</p>

<p>Obsidian has some basic support for tasks built in. But if you rely on notifications for when to do what, then you’re going to need a dedicated task manager. Fortunately, there’s a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin">Todoist plugin</a> for Obsidian which allows you to have the best of both worlds - you can capture tasks into Todoist directly and get notified on your devices when it’s time to do a task, but you can also embed those tasks into an Obsidian so you can associate them with a particular project. In this post, I’m going to show you how to use the Todoist Sync community plugin to embed tasks using Todoist’s filters in Obsidian.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Todoist-Sync-Plugin"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Todoist-Sync-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Todoist Sync Plugin"></a>Setting up the Todoist Sync Plugin</h2><p>First, click on the gear icon in the lower left to access the Obsidian Settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist1.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, go to <em>Community plugins</em> and click on <em>Browse</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist2.jpg"></p>
<p>Search for <em>Todoist</em>, and select the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin">Todoist Sync plugin</a>. Click on the plugin, then click <em>Install</em> and then <em>Enable</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist3.jpg"></p>
<p>For the plugin to sync with the Todoist app you’re going to need your Todoist API token. You can click the link access your API token on the web, or you can open the Todoist app and go to <em>Settings –&gt; Integrations</em> and scroll down to the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist4.jpg"></p>
<p>Once you find your API token, copy it to your clipboard and go back into Obsidian. Paste the API token into the field and then click <em>Submit</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist5.jpg"></p>
<p>Once you have your API token set, you’re ready to start using the plugin.</p>
<h2 id="Embedding-Todoist-Tasks-in-a-Note"><a href="#Embedding-Todoist-Tasks-in-a-Note" class="headerlink" title="Embedding Todoist Tasks in a Note"></a>Embedding Todoist Tasks in a Note</h2><p>You can embed Todoist tasks inside any note file, like this blank one I have for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.relay.fm/focused">Focused podcast</a> that I do with David Sparks.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist6.jpg"></p>
<p>To embed Todoist tasks into a note, we use the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;name&quot;: &quot;(NAME)&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;filter&quot;:  &quot;(FILTER)&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</blockquote>
<p>The variables we can change here are <em>name</em> and <em>filter</em>. The <em>name</em> is simply the title that will be displayed at the top of the section once we embed the tasks. The <em>filter</em> is any valid Todoist filter. If you’re new to Todoist filters, check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thesweetsetup.com/an-introduction-to-filters-in-todoist/">this article by Jeff Abbott</a> as an introduction or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-filters">official documentation on the Todoist website</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a couple of examples:</p>
<p>If I wanted to show all tasks that were either due today or overdue, I would use this code:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Today &amp; Overdue&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;filter&quot;:  &quot;(today | overdue)&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</blockquote>
<p>Once I switch to Preview mode, the embedded tasks look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist7.jpg"></p>
<p>If you want to filter by project you can do that by using <code>#</code> and then the project name. So if I wanted to show all tasks associated with the NeuYear Focused calendar project, I would use this code:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Focused Calendar&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;filter&quot;:  &quot;#Focused 2022 Calendar&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</blockquote>
<p>This code would render in Preview mode like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist8.jpg"></p>
<p>If you want to filter by tag you can do that using <code>@</code> and then the tag name. So if I wanted to show all tasks associated with the <em>focused</em> tag, I would use this code:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;name&quot;: &quot;All Focused tasks&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&quot;filter&quot;:  &quot;@focused&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</blockquote>
<p>This code would render in Preview mode like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist9.jpg"></p>
<p>What’s great about these embedded tasks is that you can check the boxes to complete the tasks and the status instantly syncs back to Todoist.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Tasks-from-the-Command-Palette"><a href="#Adding-Tasks-from-the-Command-Palette" class="headerlink" title="Adding Tasks from the Command Palette"></a>Adding Tasks from the Command Palette</h2><p>You can also add tasks to Todoist straight from Obsidian by using the <em>Command Palette</em>. Just hit <em>Command - P</em> to open the Command Palette and type <code>Todoist</code>. What you’ll see is a complete list of the commands enabled by the Todoist Sync plugin:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist10.jpg"></p>
<p>From here, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refresh the metadata (pull in any changes from Todoist that isn’t syncing)</li>
<li>Add a Todoist task</li>
<li>Add a Todoist task with a callback URL link to the current Obsidian note</li>
</ul>
<p>Select <em>Add a Todoist task</em> and you’ll get a popup window which you can use to add the task name and any additional metadata. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist11.jpg"></p>
<p>Once you add the information you want, click <em>Add</em>.</p>
<p>You may notice that the task doesn’t immediately show up in your embedded Todoist task list, even if it falls into the requirements for the active filter. To get it to show up, simply click the <em>Refresh</em> button of the embedded Todoist task list in Preview mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/todoist12.jpg"></p>
<p>You can also set the plugin to automatically refresh and customize the time interval in the Todoist Sync plugin settings.</p>

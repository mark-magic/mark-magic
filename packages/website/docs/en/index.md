## Introduction

A data connection and transformation tool based on Markdown, solving the data conversion between different tools and the coordination between some commonly used tools.

Some use cases

1.  Publish notes online, such as generating content required for a Hexo blog from Joplin note tool to publish on the web at <https://blog.rxliuli.com/>.
2.  Publish a novel online, such as generating a novel website from local Markdown files to publish at <https://tts.liuli.moe/>.
3.  Package a novel into an EPUB file, such as packaging "To the Stars" into an EPUB for easy offline reading, available at <https://github.com/liuli-moe/to-the-stars/releases>.

Some previous community use cases

1.  Joplin => Hugo for generating a blog.
2.  Joplin => Jekyll for generating a blog.
3.  There may be others...

## Why not use existing tools

We have already used many tools for different tasks, but they are all based on Markdown, such as:

- Using Joplin for note-taking.
- Using Hexo for writing blogs.
- Using Vitepress for generating documentation websites.
- Using Docusaurus for generating SEO-friendly novel websites.
- Using Pandoc for generating EPUBs.

What really causes us pain is that when using Docusaurus, each novel requires a lot of configuration, which is very annoying. So we hope to have a better tool that can be used out of the box.

## Getting Started

Here are two examples:

1.  [Generating a website and EPUB for a novel](./book.md)
2.  [Generating a blog from notes](./blog.md)

Thanks to chatgpt, mark-magic now has its own mascot.

## Introduction

A data connection and transformation tool based on markdown, solving data conversion between different tools and coordination between some commonly used tools.

Some use cases

1.  Publishing notes online, for example, generating content required for a hexo blog from the joplin note tool and publishing it online at <https://blog.rxliuli.com/>.
2.  Publishing a novel online, for example, generating a novel website from a local markdown file and publishing it at <https://tts.liuli.moe/>.
3.  Packaging novels into epub files, for example, packaging "To the Stars" into an epub file for easy offline reading at <https://github.com/liuli-moe/to-the-stars/releases>.

Some use cases from the community

1.  Joplin => hugo to generate blogs
2.  Joplin => jeykll to generate blogs
3.  And possibly others...

## Why not use existing tools

We have already used many tools to handle different tasks, but they are all based on markdown, such as:

- Using joplin to take notes
- Using hexo to write blogs
- Using vitepress to generate documentation websites
- Using docusaurus to generate SEO-friendly novel websites
- Using pandoc to generate epubs

What really bothers us is when using docusaurus, each novel requires a lot of configuration, which is very annoying. Therefore, we hope to have a better out-of-the-box tool.

## Getting started

Here are two examples:

1.  [Generating a website and epub for a novel](./book.md)
2.  [Generating a blog from notes](./blog.md)

Thanks to chatgpt, mark-magic now has a cute mascot.

## Introduction

A data connection and transformation tool based on markdown, solving the data transformation between different tools and the coordination between some commonly used tools.

Some use cases

1. Publish some notes on the internet, for example, generate content needed by hexo blogs from the joplin note tool to publish on the internet <https://blog.rxliuli.com/>
2. Publish a novel on the internet, for example, generate a novel website from local markdown files to publish, <https://tts.liuli.moe/>
3. Package the novel into epub files, for example, package To the Stars into epub, for offline reading after download, <https://github.com/liuli-moe/to-the-stars/releases>

Some previous community use cases

1. joplin => hugo generates a blog
2. joplin => jeykll generates a blog
3. There may be others...

## Why not use existing tools

We have already used many tools to handle different tasks, but they are all based on markdown, for example

- Use joplin to record notes
- Use hexo to write blogs
- Use vitepress to generate documentation sites
- Use docusaurus to generate SEO friendly novel websites
- Use pandoc to generate epub

What really pains us is that when using docusaurus, each novel needs to configure a bunch of things, which is very annoying, so we hope there is a better out-of-the-box tool.

## Get Started

Next, two examples are given

1. [Generate websites and epub electronic files for novels](./book.md)
2. [Generate blogs from notes](./blog.md)

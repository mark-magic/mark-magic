                    Madoka had been able to see the strings as long as she could remember, they were just always there,
                    and her parents just thought she had a vibrant imagination, but she always knew it was a little
                    more. Deep in her soul.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone had them, stretching off and disappearing until they met the other side of that string. Of
                    that relationship. Most were clear, nearly colorless, and as thin as thread. Countless bundles of
                    them floating gently. They were so numerous that sometimes she wondered how people made that many
                    connections. Met that many people.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The threads were also almost always paired, the two threads floating and stretching in a double
                    helix, wrapping around each other. Not all were like that, but many. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The stronger ones though… There were fewer, but they had colors, often many colors. Her own parents
                    had quite a few purple ones, with other colors muddled through, in their threads of various sizes.
                    Some were as thick as ribbons, while others were about as wide as hands. Her own two from her
                    parents were large and beautiful, if a different shade of purple then her parents own intertwined
                    ribbons, but just about as large.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Her friends though had much different ones, they had threads of faint purple going through them now,
                    but they were mostly yellow, Sayaka’s leaning more towards a more golden color with white threaded
                    through consistently, while Hitomi’s was more strongly yellow. Kyousuke’s were the faintest between
                    them, but it wasn’t by too much. Although he did have a weird one, that was fairly large and seemed
                    to connect to his violin??? That was always an odd one.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The countless threads, strings, and ribbons… They were beautiful. Criss crossing and becoming
                    intertwined. She could always look, and understand the relationship between two people.  Maybe not
                    perfectly, but the ribbons didn’t lie. No matter what color they were, they were never truly wrong.
                    Whether they were green with rage, black with despair, or any other color, they never lied. Not even
                    the grey, ripped and worn ones lied. Their remnants barely holding on to the barest remnants of what
                    had been a connection.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka still remembered beginning to understand what gray meant. Remember her parents each having
                    one of their connections lose color, tear, and <em>snap</em>. It turned out after the fact that one
                    of her grandparents had died.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She was still so thankful she told Hitomi and Sayaka the day after she found out, as the funeral was
                    planned out. She had been scared, sad that someone she knew was dead, and hadn’t been able to
                    comprehend that she had known for over an hour before her Mom and Dad found out. Was thankful they
                    had believed her, and seemed happy to ask her about the power.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She always wondered why she had them, and her friends had even helped with various possible answers
                    for why she might, like her parents were superheroes or she just was the reincarnation of a magical
                    girl and other things, but none ever felt quite like a purpose. None felt right. Like a way to use
                    these powers to help people. The closest she had gotten was getting other people near her to help
                    when there was a clearly unbalanced and scary pair of strings, like one between a bully and victim.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Then one day she woke up.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    And found a massive, tightly coiled ribbon. It was a deep, bright purple, the size of her fist even
                    with how twisted it was, and threaded through with other colors. Black, despair, and red, devotion
                    were the most notable, but yellow friendship threads were also there in vast quantities, not to
                    mention the occasional white hope thread and…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The fading setting in across it, parts of it torn, other parts almost threadbare, shredded scraps
                    barely holding on as the massive connection connected to her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was beautiful and terrifying in ways she didn’t have words to describe. She had never even seen
                    one this large before. She had only a handful of large connections herself, so it wasn’t like she
                    had much of an impact. It did seem possible for one person to know and care about someone in such a
                    way. But this connection just… hadn’t been there last morning. Now it was so thick and obviously
                    filled with an immense amount of emotion. She actually blushed a little at the thought that whoever
                    was on the other end loved her, especially to this degree. Even if she wasn’t fully sure whether it
                    was platonic or… romantic love. It was almost like one of those love letters she had been wanting to
                    get.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The most terrifying part though, was the implication of the grey, torn parts.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Death.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>By all rights, it should mean death.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet the connection wasn’t snapped. It was still there, spitefully being held together, its own
                    threads making sure even the most errant pieces didn’t fly away in the wind.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She had no idea what this meant. And when she went to school that morning was even more confused
                    when she saw a similar, but much smaller and more tattered ribbon connected to Sayaka. Its threads
                    were green and yellow, other threads mixed through.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She thought about it for several days, wondering what it could mean as it twitched around,
                    occasionally moving to practically her entire other side in the space between blinks. The only two
                    things that came to mind was that it was the connection from some sort of ghost or guardian angel
                    that she had just recently become able to see or… well honestly she didn’t even have a second
                    explanation. She had no idea what it could be. What connection could just… <em>appear</em> in such a
                    state.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>It was bizarre, and not normal.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Not that being able to see the strings that tie people together was normal. So she supposed she
                    couldn’t complain too much about things getting odder.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the dream she could barely remember, with a girl with long black hair fighting something
                    immense, something white asking her for something… asking her too…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She couldn’t remember.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    When she went to school that day, she wasn’t expecting anything. It was just a normal day at school,
                    and she was starting to get used to the new ribbon, even if she didn’t understand it.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then as Saotome stopped her rant, a newly green and brown thread wearing away and smaller than it
                    used to be floating about her, she welcomed a new transfer student.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka’s eyes immediately widened in shock when the full Ribbon became visible. The massive ribbon’s
                    owner suddenly got closer. Connecting together with hers and Sayaka’s, and even a faint and
                    minuscule thread she hadn’t noticed connecting to Hitomi.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She watched the beautiful girl step in front of class, and stare right at her after writing her
                    name. Massive, almost ropelike ribbon tying them together.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>And Madoka was only more confused.</p>

                  <p>
                    Madoka found her eyes wandering to Akemi as the class continued, the beautiful girl with a massive
                    heartstring going to her of all people, and she still had no idea why. She’d never met the girl
                    before besides in that odd dream. Yet the massive ribbon from the girl connecting them…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Love, despair, devotion, friendship, a little bit of hope, and <em>death</em>. All things she had no
                    idea why a seemingly normal girl would have such a bond towards her. Especially out of nowhere like
                    Akemi’s. If it had been there for a long time, slowly building up to this, she might be able to
                    understand most of this if that had been the case. The girl seeing her do something and slowly
                    fantasizing over the years could certainly explain most of it, besides the grey and wear and tear.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She literally didn’t know. Even as she lightly took it into her hand. Feeling it. Knowing
                    instinctively the greyness still meant death as the large almost ropelike bond almost twisted around
                    her hand. A small and slowly forming thread of her own slowly returning the favor and wrapping
                    around the larger ribbon.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>But <em>why did it mean death?</em></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It wasn’t like such an effect could happen through a mistake. She knew that one particular one was
                    rather literally what happened when one of the bondholders died. It <em>only</em> appeared then. She
                    knew it innately. Deeply. In the same way she could see the bonds. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    So that meant something not normal was going on, like she had expected. But instead of it being some
                    faceless guardian angel or ghost, the source was a transfer student in her class. She blushed
                    lightly, looking away and letting go of the ribbon, although it didn’t let go of her. Staying
                    wrapped around her wrist, and almost pulling on her. There wasn’t any real force but… She could feel
                    it trying to pull her. She shivered, conflicted and confused emotions lancing through her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Bonds would wrap around others a bit at times, but never felt like they were actually approaching
                    exerting actual force.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Yet there was this one, which looked at all her knowledge of bonds and spat in its face.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    That wasn’t even mentioning the other odd, semi shredded bonds coming out of the girl. Even if none
                    were as large as her own, or purple with love...
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Her thoughts continued to bounce between half formed idea’s as Saotome taught, wondering what was
                    going on, and what to do about it. She couldn’t just pretend <em>nothing</em> was going on… could
                    she?
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    By the time class ended, her thoughts were something a mess. The idea of Homura- Akemi being her
                    guardian angel was incredibly distracting. She wasn’t sure what else it could be though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <br />Although on the other hand, she didn’t know what else it could be. Conceptually. She simply
                    didn’t know what the limits of weirdness were. Madoka needed a reference point on what oddness there
                    was in the world other than her power. But it was also the only one she knew.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Besides whatever was going on with Homura at least, as the girl was surrounded by other girls trying
                    to find out about her. She wondered for a moment whether she should go over there herself to talk…
                    but she wouldn’t be able to say anything in class. At least not without being labeled as crazy by
                    everyone around her besides maybe Akemi. Just as she was about to try to think of something, the
                    girl started holding her head, and said she needed to go to the nurse's office.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka blinked, then remembered being told of the girl's condition, and immediately knew this was
                    both her chance, and something she should help with. She prepared to get up, but Akemi beat her to
                    it, and before she could even do anything, the girl had walked over to her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Could you escort me to the Nurse’s office?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Uh, of course!” Madoka exclaimed in slight shock. Although she supposed she shouldn't be given what
                    her powers said.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    During the walk though, she tried to talk to Akemi, no, the girl gave her permission to use her
                    first name, Homura kept walking, giving her simple answers as she walked ahead of her, if she
                    responded at all. At least until they reached the suspended pathway, and Homura turned towards her,
                    asking her whether her current life, family, and friends were important to her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka’s eyes widened, wondering whether this was a ‘call to adventure’ even past her confusion at
                    the abruptness of the question, not to mention the subject matter. After a moment of thought, she
                    responded that she did. She loved them. When Homura asked her again to confirm, she was confused,
                    but confirmed again.<br /><br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then Homura told her to never change or she would lose it all, that all she needed to be was Madoka
                    Kaname, and then began walking away. The odd words leaving Madoka confused, especially in their
                    earnestness.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>As Madoka looked at the odd bond though, she immediately firmed her resolve.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Wait!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura stopped, looking back with a questioning expression, even as her lips stayed pressed
                    together. “What is it?
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka almost hesitated, then forced herself to ask. “Are you… are you my guardian angel or
                    something?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She instantly felt stupid as soon as the words left her mouth. Flushing as the girl looked at her
                    with emotions Madoka couldn’t quite parse flitting through her eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Before she could even try to say she was joking or laugh it off or anything, Homura responded. “Why
                    are you asking such a question?” 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka blinked, as she wasn’t rejected out of hand, Homura seemed confused and shocked, to the point
                    that she seemed… a lot more expressive than she had been before. Whatever facade she had put up
                    cracking at the unexpected question.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She continued, hope and panic spurring her on. “I, um, I have had a special ability ever since I
                    could remember… I can see threads and ribbons between people, representing their relationships and
                    feelings about others. And a few days ago I woke up with a really big one out of nowhere attached to
                    me. One that was weird in ways that shouldn’t be possible, and that I didn’t fully understand… Then
                    when you entered the class I realized who the source was even if I didn’t understand… So I uh, well,
                    with my ability I know there's odd magical things in the world, and due to the bond I can only
                    assume there's something special about you too and that was one of the most obvious things that came
                    to mind…”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka flushed harder as she stopped herself from continuing to vomit out words. Especially given
                    how Homura had gotten more shocked and confused the whole time she spoke. Had she messed things up
                    between them trying to tell a virtual stranger about her power, even though her power showed her
                    that Homura obviously cared for her for some reason? Even if something weird was obviously going on?
                    She almost opened her mouth to try again to pass it off as a joke or something but… no words came
                    out. She looked down, afraid that she’d messed up a friendship mounting, then soft hands came down
                    on her shoulders, and she looked up into Homura’s shining purple eyes, eyes oh so reminiscent of the
                    emotional bond tying Madoka to the black haired girl.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“I… I believe you. Meet me after school and we can talk.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura turned quickly once more, prompting Madoka to quickly catch up as she walked, not entirely
                    looking at her, but not looking away. Just still seeming confused and shocked, but not disbelieving,
                    even as Madoka got into step next to the girl, who was obviously thinking deeply. Barely noticing
                    the world around her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka looked at her own slowly coloring thread around the massive coiled ribbon though, and smiled
                    softly as she saw something she hadn’t quite been expecting.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The large ribbon was slowly becoming whiter, the white threads starting to encroach on the black
                    ones.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She had no idea what was happening with Homura.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    But she was happy that hope was starting to bleach out and replace the girl's sadness and despair.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Madoka watched Homura with amazement for the rest of the day, she hadn’t been expecting any of this
                    today, besides the fact that they would be having a transfer student join them. Now she knew the
                    source of the strange bond, and it was the odd but immensely smart girl who she would be talking to
                    after school. It was honestly mind boggling how good the girl was at everything. Even breaking
                    records in PE. The only thing she wasn’t average in was her power, and Homura appeared to have
                    something extraordinary in some way as well, while being amazing at everything she did. Not to
                    mention that as Sayaka had pointed out, she was gorgeous to- Madoka flushed as she noticed her own
                    bond slowly becoming light pink. Remembering how both her friends' bonds with Kyousuke had slowly
                    become pink and then purple over time.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… Uh oh.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She immediately decided to ignore those potential budding feelings for now. At least it couldn’t be
                    more complicated than whatever would happen when one of her two friends chose to confess to
                    Kyousuke. She still remembered her mom telling her that her friends would have to work it out
                    between themselves when she asked for advice because of how awkward that situation was.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She shook herself out of those thoughts. That was thankfully not currently her problem, even if she
                    might have to help them with the inevitable fallout, and comfort them if they needed it.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    When lunch came around, she tried to invite Homura, but the girl was already… somewhere. Madoka
                    didn’t know how the girl had moved so fast, or where she had gone. Madoka pouted for a moment, but
                    she also didn’t know anything clear about Homura, so she couldn’t say anything. Even if she wanted
                    to invite the girl, Homura might need to do something, or have something her special thing, whatever
                    it was, should be involved in in some way.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then Hitomi and Sayaka began talking about Homura, quickly causing Madoka to talk about most of the
                    chat, listening to Sayaka wonder whether something cool was going to be happening with stuff like
                    her ability. Madoka blushed, and then told them about the dream, which was enough to make Sayaka
                    almost mutinous in sheer excitement, and Hitomi wasn’t much better. Even if she seemed to at least
                    be trying to hide her own excitement. Especially when she continued, telling them of the weird bond
                    that had appeared recently, and how Homura had agreed to meet her after class. Now they really were
                    mutinous. Hitomi looked really upset that she had a class and couldn’t come with, while Sayaka…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I have to come too! You can’t go along with some weird girl who might have powers you barely know
                    alone!” Even though Sayaka’s words were in opposition to Homura, Madoka could see that the girl was
                    just curious. Immensely so. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka sighed a little. “Sayaka…” She thought for a moment, especially about the bond connected to
                    Sayaka, then nodded slightly. Causing Sayaka’s eyes to light up. “But Homura also has to agree,
                    alright?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Of course! I’ll make sure she agrees to bring me along!” Suddenly she felt a bit of regret. Homura
                    was going to have to deal with the full brunt of Sayaka’s stubbornness.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    A little later that day, they said goodbye to the disappointed Hitomi, and walked over to Homura’s
                    desk, causing the girl to look up in slight confusion, but after introductions between the Sayaka
                    and her she followed them outside before speaking up. “Why are you also here?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka immediately responded. “Because I’m not being left out of whatever nonsense is happening
                    here! Madoka may be the one with powers, but that doesn’t mean I’m just gonna leave her to find out
                    about cool things going on in the world without me!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura cringed, but couldn’t quite seem to figure out a way to argue the girl down. Causing her to
                    purse her lips, then nod. Turning and walking to wherever she wanted to talk.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It took them a while to make it, but eventually they ended up in front of an apartment in the middle
                    of the city, walking in, and finding themselves in a room that seemed more like a high tech lab then
                    a home. The walls stark white as a pendulum shifted back and forth. It really did give off the
                    impression that <em>something </em>magical was going on. Even as they walked over and sat and on the
                    couch across from each other. The bonds twirling around each other. Even Sayaka seemed to be a bit
                    too shocked to speak, and Homura said nothing for several minutes. Seemingly somewhere between
                    content with the silence, and not knowing what to say.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Just as Madoka was about to try and prompt her, Homura opened her mouth.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“I… I suppose you could say I’m a magical girl.”</p>

                      but now… she was barely keeping herself from jumping across the table. Madoka’s eyes were so wide
                      that Sayaka had a feeling her best friend was feeling similarly. “Really!?”</span

                      watched as the ring on Homura’s finger glowed, becoming a large purple gem in her hand. She
                      watched the gem as it glowed, wonder filling her with proof of magical girls being real in front
                      of her. “This is my soul gem, the mark of being a magical girl.”</span

                      should make if you enjoy your current lives.” Homura’s voice was level, but hostile, Sayaka felt
                      the excitement flow out of her, replaced by confusion.</span

                      glaring face turned to Madoka, but noticed it softened upon doing so. Not massively but… Well, she
                      believed Madoka's powers for a reason.</span

                    <span
                      >Homura seemed to struggle for a moment, before sighing. “The one who makes magical girls, Kyubey,
                      or more accurately the Incubator, even if it does not often give out that name, looks like a white
                      cat thing. Rather like other magical girl mascots honestly. When it meets someone with the
                      potential, it offers them a contract. They get one wish, and in exchange they have to fight
                      witches for it, beings born of despair that spread said despair like a curse. Causing suicides and
                      eating the souls of their victims.” Sayaka was about ready to just jump up and ask why she
                      couldn’t contract then. All of that sounded amazing, and the only odd part so far was the
                      Incubators whole name thing. Hell, as she looked at Madoka beside her, she knew the girl wasn’t
                      much better, obviously interested too.</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>A wish and the capacity to help others practically sounded like a dream come true.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>

                    <span
                      >But Sayaka kept her mouth shut. She knew Madoka could see… her own feelings towards Kyousuke. Not
                      to mention her best friend's parents bonds between each other, yet she’d called the bond from
                      Homura the biggest she’d really seen. Given the bit of description Madoka had given about what it
                      meant… Sayaka knew the girl had to care a lot about Madoka, probably at least.</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>So why would Homura recommend against something like this?</span>
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    <span
                      >They both looked at her questioningly. She looked directly at them, flipping her hair rather
                      magnificently after a moment, and then continuing. “That is as far as it instructs them, however
                      that is not the full terms of the contract.” Homura looked down at the gem in her hand. “The name
                      of this, the soul gem created when a magical girl contracts, is literal. This stone contains my
                      soul, and if it were to ever be broken, I would die instantly.” Sayaka felt practically all
                      interest in being a magical die at those words, horror filling her instead. From what little she
                      could see of Madoka’s frozen face, eyes wide and mouth open, she was probably about the same. “The
                      Incubator says it is to allow us to fight without reservations, as it dulls our pain response
                      greatly, and as long as we have magic and our soul gem we can theoretically heal from any amount
                      of damage. Because of this, I have heard other magical girls who discovered this fact call us
                      terms such as zombies or empty husks-”</span

                    <span
                      >Sayaka felt sick, so she was thankful as Madoka interrupted. “You aren’t! I know that! My power
                      shows the bonds you have, and uh…” she seemed embarrassed by her outburst, but Homura’s face just
                      stayed blank, if somewhat appreciative.</span
                    >
                  </p>

                    <span
                      >“Thank you Madoka Kaname,” Come to think of it, that was a weird way of referring to Madoka, but
                      Sayaka dropped it for now. The whole magical girl thing was more important. “Unfortunately while I
                      would like to say it gets better, it does not. The connection only works for 100 meters, after
                      which the magical girl's body effectively dies, and the soul gem has to be manually reconnected by
                      being brought into contact. And while a magical girl can heal as long as they have magic, their
                      magic is limited. In fact, a magical girl's soul gem grows darker when they use magic, step into a
                      witch's labyrinth, slowly over time, or rapidly if they fall into despair. Until eventually it
                      becomes completely dark.” Sayaka was really starting to feel nervous now, this felt like it would
                      be hyping up to something, but what? “If it isn’t purified with grief seeds, the objects obtained
                      for killing witches, the soul gem will become a grief seed, and the magical girl will become a
                      witch. Spreading despair for all the hope she brought. This process cannot be reversed by any
                      magic I know of.”</span

                      was saying at a rapid pace. listening to Homura as she went on about the magical girl system, but
                      barely hearing it. She turned to Madoka, who had tears slowly beginning to flow down her face,
                      especially as Homura continued talking about all the injustice of the magical girl system. She
                      couldn’t blame her, this was beyond anything she thought could be possible for how bad it could
                      be. Especially with all the warnings about the Incubator and how it would do anything to convince
                      them to contract if it set its sights on them.</span

                      clinical and almost disturbing descriptions from Homura just made her angrier the more she thought

                    Homura felt the tears falling down her cheeks as she sobbed, shivering and slightly limp. Only still
                    kept upwards by the arms around her, Madoka and Sayaka holding her close. Their heads on her
                    shoulders.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She could feel her right shoulder slowly getting wetter as Madoka’s tears soaked through her
                    clothes. She winced through her tears, feeling guilty that she had hurt Madoka. Even if she had just
                    been answering their questions. She slowly reached her arm around, holding Madoka as she cried.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She clenched her fists as she thought about the mess that had been her day. Remembered being
                    startled by the anomaly. Madoka knew how much she meant to her, and that something weird was going
                    on. Something that couldn’t be explained normally.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura had immediately scrapped all her plans, even as she checked Madoka's finger for a ring to
                    make sure she hadn’t already contracted at some point she missed. Thankfully she hadn’t but… She had
                    needed to suppress her panic, even as some part of her hoped Madoka would listen to her. Would
                    listen to her instead of the Incubator. No matter how much the thought of things derailing in such
                    an unexpected way was terrifying to her. But the thought of Madoka understanding that all she wanted
                    was to protect her was too much to turn down.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Even when Sayaka came with Madoka for the explanation, she knew she couldn’t turn it down. Sayaka’s
                    concern was understandable, and Homura could’t argue it either. No matter how much she wanted to.
                    What she did know, was that at least the girl seemed more excited than actually suspicious.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Excited.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>To talk to her.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>It was honestly a little unnerving. They rarely got along, and yet now…</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, between that, not being able to really dodge any of their questions if she wanted their trust,
                    and just wanting someone to believe her for once…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was all just so overwhelming. Especially as it seemed like every bit of distance she had planned
                    to maintain was bridged in one go as her emotions overwhelmed her, as images of Madoka’s twisted
                    form, and so many others, flashed through her mind. Countless deaths, all because she was a failure.
                    Because she wasn’t good enough. So much death, including the time when Madoka asked her too-
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She failed to suppress another sob, thankful for having spare grief seeds on hand, knowing she would
                    likely need to use one after this, despair overcoming all her mental barriers as her best friend and
                    Sayaka held her close.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    After a few minutes though, she slowly stopped, finally leashing her emotions somewhat again. Homura
                    breathed, even as she heard one of her friends say something, but it was hard to make out. Too fuzzy
                    to really hear, Her ears ringing as she tried to think. She closed her palm, reaching into her
                    magic, and accessing her shield's power. Then moved her arm from Madoka’s back, opening it as she
                    formed her soul gem in her left, and winced at the sheer amount of impurities staining it black.
                    Even as they were pulled out and into the grief seed. Which was when she noticed Madoka and Sayaka
                    watching in disturbed fascination.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Then Madoka spoke up. “Are.. are you ok now Homura?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She nodded, taking a shaky breath. “I… Yes. I am fine now. I am sorry for making you distressed.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Before she could say anything more though, both of them yelled out. “NO!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She looked between them startled, as Madoka reddened in embarrassment, and Sayaka just looked
                    slightly proud. “... What my wife and I were saying,” Madoka reddened further. “Was that it’s
                    obvious you aren’t doing great, and both of us aren’t going to mind if you could use some comfort
                    too, alright? Neither of us are going to judge you, right Madoka?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka reached up, finally moving her arm away from Homura for a moment to wipe away her tears then
                    moving it back, her expression firming into something different. A more determined expression Homura
                    usually only saw after Madoka had made a wish. She tried to lean away slightly, especially as she
                    realized how close their faces were, but between Sayaka that way, and Madoka holding her close there
                    wasn’t anywhere to move unless she stood up. “I agree with Sayaka. I can see your bond and… your
                    bond with me is so full of despair. Not to mention the other bonds. It can’t be healthy to be this
                    sad, even if you hide it- No <em>especially</em> if you hide it!” 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka was rather literally in her face at this point, even as her cheeks were still flushed from
                    Sayaka’s comment. Then growing substantially redder after a moment, but not backing down.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura felt her heart beat faster, and she wondered whether she had forgotten to heal it even as her
                    own face became warm. Everything was so warm… it felt…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>It felt relaxing.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I w-will attempt t-to...” She immediately cringed, even as the warmth made it a little easier not
                    to care. She wasn’t that girl anymore. She wasn’t the girl who had to be protected.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    But given how Madoka just squeezed her harder, shifting a bit so she could be more on Homura’s front
                    and putting her head back on her shoulder, even if that meant she was practically on Homura’s lap
                    with how small the couch was. Sayaka let out a small laugh, and moved to Homura’s back…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She shook herself, but didn’t move. Didn’t dare too. She was… honestly unsure how far the two would
                    push her boundaries, but she would practically take anything they gave her. This was already near
                    miraculous, and probably more then all but a few timelines, yet it was practically just the start of
                    the timeline. Hell, when it came right down to it, even in the timelines where they were on good
                    terms, they were never this close.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    How much did Sayaka- she caught herself for a moment, before thinking about it. If she was being
                    held this close, shouldn’t using her first name be a foregone conclusion? Still though, how much did
                    Sayaka trust Madoka’s power to so easily believe what Homura said? To immediately get their
                    relationship to seemingly be at a better point then it was in their best timelines?
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>At least they seemed content-</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She immediately began squirming out of their grip as Sayaka’s Arm’s pulled back, then an unfamiliar
                    sensation burst from her sides. Giggles being forced out of her mouth as she tried to squirm away
                    without hurting Madoka, But Madoka was still holding on tight.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She pushed herself back onto Sayaka in desperation, causing them all to fall on her thankfully
                    carpeted floor and causing her to be even more stuck after a moment as she tried to roll off of
                    Sayaka, but failed as the girl wrapped her arms thoroughly around Homura, still somehow managing to
                    get her sides and cause more irrational laugher to spill from her lips as she squirmed. Thankfully
                    it stopped after another minute, leaving her gasping.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Jeez, not great at defending against tickles are you ya big weak spot?” Homura’s eyebrows knitted
                    together for a moment. Right, she thinks she remembers others doing it on occasion.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She forced herself around in their arms, and before Sayaka could really react, immediately began
                    lashing out at the same area with similar movements. Leading to her becoming quickly stuck as Homura
                    imitated her movements and she tried to crawl out, laughing uncontrollably. Madoka giggled from
                    behind her, even as she let go after a moment, and soon approached closer to her front again.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Wow… Your smile is really pretty Homura.” She froze in shock from Madoka’s sudden words, causing
                    Sayaka to quickly break free. While she realized, Madoka was right.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She was smiling.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>How long had it been-</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She had absolutely no time to continue that train of thought as Sayaka immediately leaped at her,
                    yelling “REVENGE!” and going for her stomach this time.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    By the time they stopped, Madoka had joined in, and Sayaka was looking like she regretted that
                    declaration of Revenge.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura breathed for a moment, feeling her still present smile.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Then she sighed.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Since they knew about the time travel, they would likely have to know everything she knew about how
                    things went down, and the important players. Most of it anyways.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She prepared herself.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura certainly felt lighter then she had in… a very, <em>very</em> long time after that. But she
                    was going to have to drag herself through her memories for this.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    … With them by her side though, willing to comfort her… she didn’t think it would be as hard as it
                    was in the past.

                  <p>
                    Madoka sat next to Homura, leaning against the girl, and still a little internally shocked. Knowing
                    that Homura knew and cared about her from her bond, and actually experiencing it were two very
                    different things. She’d honestly not quite expected quite how far she had pushed the girls
                    boundaries considering… It was technically the first day she had met Homura. Sayaka was more
                    physically affectionate, and more likely to push boundaries. Yet Madoka had
                    <em>sat on Homura’s lap. </em>She flushed again, just thinking about it.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She wasn’t even sure how much of it was from embarrassment or the- she swallowed, her evident crush.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka didn’t seem that embarrassed, even if she did seem a bit less energetic then normal. Not that
                    Madoka could blame her, as she looked at the shifting bonds, colors slowly reaching through and
                    changing on both sides of all of their connections. All of them were becoming more positive colors,
                    and slowly growing.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Which was saying something, since even her and Sayaka’s bonds with Homura were already surprisingly
                    large. Almost as thick as the ribbons on her head. It was shocking how fast they were growing.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>These were special circumstances though, so it wasn’t necessarily bad.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was concerning to really look at Homura’s bond though, it was so dark, coated with so much black…
                    in fact, most of them were. Homura was surrounded by many countless grey and black ones, bound
                    together behind her into a rope. Not to mention Sayaka’s, or the other two large ones. In
                    particular…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, she had noticed them before, but she hadn’t really looked at them closely. One of them was
                    laced gold designs. A gold color that didn’t feel like friendship, but she wasn’t sure what it was.
                    While the other was hard to focus on, only mildly, almost uncomfortable to look at, yet at the same
                    time it was almost comforting.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She looked away from it. Which left her looking at some of Homura’s other bonds. Particularly, three
                    bright green ones, one of them so bright that it was practically neon. Out of the three, it was the
                    only one not grey and torn. The other two were rather shredded, and barely bothering to hold
                    together. On the other hand though, both of them felt off.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The darker one felt almost indescribable, almost slow in a way.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The lighter of the two shredded ones felt similarly, except instead of slow, it just felt… sideways.
                    That was really the only word she could use to describe it.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She blinked, then felt her slowly forming bond with Homura. Quickly realizing it had a similarly
                    indescribable feeling to it, but where the others had been near impossible to word, this one really
                    was. Not necessarily in a bad way, but it did feel <em>off</em> in a way she couldn’t ignore.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She broke the silence. “Uh, Homura, what other magical girls do you know?” She had a feeling the
                    girl knew at least a few, right? Especially given these bonds.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura shifted slightly, leaning more into her and causing Sayaka to grumble something about her
                    backrest moving. Before Homura could even speak, Sayaka moved a bit, and fell across their laps,
                    looking immensely proud of herself. Madoka flushed, and Homura sighed, but surprisingly the black
                    haired girl didn’t push Sayaka off.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I do know a few, although none of them currently know me.” Homura said, apparently deciding
                    ignoring Sayaka was the way to go. “Out of them, the two most important ones are Mami Tomoe and
                    Kyoko Sakura. Tomoe is practically in charge of Mitakihara’s territory, and she is exceptionally
                    skilled. Unfortunately she is fragile mentally, and exceptionally lonely, which makes her very
                    dangerous. Being told the truth has even been known to make her snap in unpredictable ways, and only
                    once has she recovered. To make things worse, she trusts the Incubator implicitly.” Madoka winced,
                    she had a feeling that snapping was something she didn’t want clarification on.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Jeez, can it get any worse?” Sayaka said, in a sarcastic tone.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura nodded, looking a little more despondent. “Unfortunately yes, if she doesn’t have any help
                    she will be killed by a particularly tricky witch in about a week. The witch’s grief seed apparently
                    always shows up at the Mitakihara hospital before awakening, and unfortunately isn’t consistent
                    enough that I can just get there first. I plan on attempting to form an alliance with Tomoe though
                    soon. However, depending on the Incubator I may not be successful.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka shivered. Especially as Homura continued going over the details of Mami Tomoe over the
                    timelines. Like how the girl masked her insecurities, and was often their friend unless they didn’t
                    meet. Her mind just slowly bounced between the things she learned, even as tears pricked at her eyes
                    again as she slowly learned more about the lonely girl.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then she blinked. “Wait, even if the alliance works out, why don’t you see if it’s possible to save
                    whatever magical girl became the witch?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura seemed to think for a moment, before cringing. “You… have a point. I am unsure whether I will
                    be able to with my limited information, but I will certainly try.” Homura seemed to think for a
                    moment, before shaking it off. “Unfortunately, she is not the only magical girl who I am likely to
                    interact with. Fortunately, Kyoko Sakura is far more reasonable than Mami Tomoe, at least to me.
                    She’s dangerous, but she is also less of a problem then Tomoe. Sakura tends to work alone, but she
                    isn’t insecure like Tomoe, and I can get her to work with me with relative ease if she shows up.”
                    Homura closed her eyes for a moment. Then continued. “If you ever speak with her, do not waste food
                    in front of her. The Incubator often manipulates and waits for the perfect time when the potential
                    magical girl cannot think it through, and Sakura is a strong example of those tactics. She has her
                    own trauma, and she will be exceedingly hostile if you do.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Both her and Sayaka nodded, eyes wide.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was harder to listen to the rest of Homura’s explanation, even if she wanted to. She paid
                    attention, but it was hard to focus on the words as she thought about the two girls, remembering
                    Homura’s other two large ribbons.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Eventually though, it was getting hard to pay attention. Which was when she noticed the time, and
                    felt her eyes widen a bit. “Uh, I think we might need to go home soon, Sayaka.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka looked up at the holographic clock, and winced, before seeming to think for a moment. “You
                    have a point… but I think I’d like to stay over with you if your parents are cool with it.” Madoka
                    nodded, pulling out her phone and preparing to send her parents a message, before she sent it
                    though, she froze, looking at Homura.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Her face firmed. “Would you like to come as well, Homura?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura turned towards her, looking a little shocked, opened her mouth for a moment, then closed it,
                    seeming to think. “I… I would enjoy that, although I will not be able to tomorrow. I already gave up
                    hunting a witch today for my alliance with Tomoe and will need to do so soon.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Madoka smiled, nodding.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She had a lot of catch up to do after all if considering this rather unique situation.</p>

                    The terminal assigned to target 945728: Madoka Kaname watched. The potential magical girl seemed to
                    have record breaking magic potential, but it was uncertain why. An anomaly.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Hypothesis, possible importance unseen.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Conclusion unable to be verified.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Current theories seem to indicate that a magical girl's potential is dictated by their karmic
                    importance. Little indication on target potential. Even scouring public records as it watched her
                    carefully for data gave little. The likely ballpark for where her magic potential should be is
                    estimated at medium to high, possibly roughly equivalent to Mami Tomoe. Cause for anomalously high
                    KD unable to be found.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Possible explanation, The anomaly.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Data inconclusive.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It watched the target follow the anomaly to what appeared to be the anomaly’s home. Another girl,
                    public records indicating her name was Sayaka Miki, was also following. Noting down potential for
                    contracting and various surrounding factors for future use.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The anomaly, data found indicating her name to be Homura Akemi, was a magical girl. This should not
                    normally be feasible. No records of contracting her exist.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Possible conclusions; Unknown contractor, wish with record erasing properties or side effects, time
                    manipulation, unaccounted for magical girl taking control via soul gem connection, and an unassisted
                    wish.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Not enough data to choose, temporarily limiting most statistically unlikely solutions too
                    inconsistent. Unknown factors too open ended.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Amendment, high probability that an unassisted wish is not the cause. Formation of a soul gem
                    detected.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Method temporarily written off.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Threat assessment unknown, proceed with caution, do not approach without more meaningful data.</p>

                  <p>
                    They have entered the apartment, location has been noted for future use and investigation. Barrier
                    has also been deployed on the location. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Subverting the barrier and entering has been deemed a waste of energy, unknown magical girls
                    intentions are unspecified, but many magical girls do not take their security and territory
                    infiltrated well. Possible high waste of energy and limitation of methods if the magical girl is
                    hostile and destroys this terminal in front of the other potentials.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Amendment, limitation of clarification on Homura Akemi’s knowledge could potentially lead to greater
                    limitation of methods.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Inconclusive data, continuing to gather data until Homura Akemi is proven to be hostile, neutral, or
                    beneficial to its goals.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    After a few hours, the girls began walking out of the apartment, walking together in the same
                    direction. Given gathered data on their residence locations, it appears Madoka Kaname and Sayaka
                    Miki are headed home.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Amendment. The continued presence of Homura Akemi indicates they are more likely to be heading to
                    the same location. Given the distances involved, and the societal disinclination for females to go
                    out at night alone, there is a high likelihood of them staying together tonight. Likely at the
                    Kaname residence given its relative distance to Akemi’s residence being shorter.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It noted down all available info it could get as they walked. Given the implementation of her
                    barrier Akemi was very private, so it was unlikely it would be able to get close enough to observe
                    when they reached the residence. Notable factors at the moment were that the target and Sayaka Miki
                    were holding the anomaly’s hands. Observed data puts this pattern of behaviour as unusual. They have
                    rapidly formed some kind of relationship.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Conclusion: They are likely to trust the anomaly.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Solution: Given current data, getting them to meet Mami Tomoe as soon as possible to form a foothold
                    is crucial. Do so at the first available opportunity.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It continued watching until they reached the Kaname residence, another low level barrier encompassed
                    the building in moments. It quickly began hopping between the nearby buildings, getting a vantage
                    point that allowed observation of the targets room, which was entered by the group after a moment,
                    Curtains quickly covering the windows and preventing further observation.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Task has become more of a waste of energy then any potential data it could likely gain would be
                    worth. It began walking off, finding more useful tasks to accomplish until more observation could be
                    done.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>---</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Tomohisa looked at the hallway leading towards the front door as he heard it open, smiling as Madoka
                    appeared with Miki and the new friend she had decided to bring along. A black haired girl looking a
                    little wide eyed, but not at anything in the house, more at how Miki and Madoka were holding her
                    hands and dragging her forward.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    He could hardly imagine Junko’s reaction. It’ll be entertaining at least. He turned back to his
                    cooking as Tatsuya stopped playing with a toy and started waddling over. “Mad’ka! Mad’ka!” Madoka
                    immediately smiled, leaning down and hugging her brother. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Welcome home Madoka, Tatsuya missed you as you can see.” He let out a soft laugh, which Madoka
                    returned. “It’s also nice to see you, Miki.” 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Hi Mr Kaname!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    He directed his next greeting to the black haired girl. “It’s always nice to see my daughter make a
                    new friend, I’m Tomohisa Kaname, and you are?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She bowed. “I’m Homura Akemi, thank you for letting me stay over.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    He waved her off. “It’s nice to meet you, and it's no big deal. If you ever need to, you're free to
                    stay over.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She looked at him shocked, but didn’t disagree. He would leave the offer open though. He remembered
                    Madoka asking to invite a new friend over since nobody else was there, before stopping, and asking
                    where Akemi’s parents were. Barely hearing the response that they weren’t around.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    He wasn’t sure whether she was an orphan or if they were on business trips or what, but he knew
                    Junko would agree that they should at least give a standing offer. Maybe she would accept, or she
                    wouldn’t, but for now it was better to leave the offer open. A fourteen year old shouldn’t be living
                    by themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Dinner will be ready in half an hour, so why don’t you all go have some fun before you have to go
                    do your schoolwork afterwards.” Miki and Madoka froze for a second, before looking a bit
                    embarrassed. He laughed a bit internally at the thought that they had forgotten. Akemi looked fine
                    though.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    They quickly ran off to Madoka’s room, and he refocused on dinner as Tatsuya happily snacked on… a
                    bit of pocky? He blinked for a moment, before just shaking his head. It looked like Akemi was
                    definitely a kind person at least. Not that he expected much else, his daughter might not be the
                    most exceptional student, but she was exceptionally good at judging people's character. Better than
                    her mother even, and that was impressive. Not to mention how kind and selfless she was. Both he and
                    Junko were proud of her. The school education was also practically was redone with more advanced
                    subjects every few years. The curriculum was already a lot more rigorous than it was when He was a
                    child, and Mitakihara middle school in particular was known for getting a bit on the advanced side,
                    even if they had a reputation of being good enough at teaching that it made little difference.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    He still remembered that night where Junko took Saotome out to drink after the eccentric woman
                    became a teacher there. That had certainly been a long and entertaining night. Especially when they
                    all went home together…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Ah, but that was in the past.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    More importantly, he really was proud of her, no matter how much she didn’t seem to fully
                    internalize it. Hopefully Madoka, Miki, Shizuki, Kamijo, and Akemi will be friends for a long time.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Once he finished dinner, he headed to the door, hearing Miki’s laughter on the other side, then some
                    conversation he couldn’t quite catch. He ignored it though, and just yelled out. “It’s dinner time!”
                    before walking back.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then Miki rushed to the table, with Madoka only slower to the degree of being polite, and Homura
                    calmly walking behind them, but her eyes looked over the food set out with interest.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was quite entertaining watching Miki bounce between eating food at a rapid pace, and talking
                    rapidly about all sorts of childhood stories and various interests, while Madoka spoke when Miki was
                    eating. Akemi just seemed to be politely listening, and occasionally asking a question, seemingly
                    happy to do so. Eventually though, Miki asked a question.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“By the way, Homura, what do you enjoy doing?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Akemi seemed to freeze for a moment, visibly putting thought into the question. “I have not had many
                    hobbies due to my rather consistent and long hospital stays. I enjoy reading, and I used to go watch
                    certain kinds of ballet performances… but that was a long time ago.” He immediately felt far more
                    concerned.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ah, I’m sorry, but do you have a condition if you went to the hospital so often? I wouldn’t want
                    you to miss taking some medicine or anything if you need it.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She frowned, shaking her head. “I had a heart condition for most of my life, and just recently had
                    surgery to correct it after transferring in from catholic school. I am completely fine now.” His
                    expression didn’t change, but it was a close thing. He watched her from behind his glasses, and
                    heard Miki begin to take over the conversation and redirect to playing video games together if they
                    had time after schoolwork. This girl was living on her own, the evidence that she was an orphan
                    mounting with that bit of knowledge about her last school, and she was recovering from a heart
                    condition.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>As Junko would say, ‘What fucking dumbass thought that was a good idea?!’</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    He had a feeling now that Junko would be considering adopting the girl herself if possible, and he
                    fully understood why, and agreed. If the girl accepted at least. They would certainly want her to
                    feel comfortable first.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then he noticed that Akemi was beginning to talk more, and when Madoka said that she really wasn’t
                    that great at most things, Akemi said that she was underestimating herself.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Causing Madoka to blush almost as red as a tomato.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    As the girls finished their meal and went off to go get their schoolwork done, he made one small
                    change to his earlier statement. They would offer to foster her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Junko would be laughing about this for months.</p>

                    Homura slowly felt herself wake up, some long ingrained habit making her immediately open her eyes
                    and look up at the familiar but wrong ceiling. She was unable to comprehend why for a moment other
                    than ‘not home’, until she blinked, and felt the recent events snap into her mind. Everything, from
                    Madoka’s odd new power, to Madoka and Sayaka asking her questions on the first day, fully believing
                    everything she said, trusting her, caring for her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Just yesterday, Homura had still been referring to Sayaka by her last name, and now she knew it
                    would be immensely hard to go back. She could hear both the girls sleeping, Sayaka in a nearby
                    futon, and Madoka in her bed.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet all Homura could think about was how she wanted more of what she got yesterday. More affection
                    and kindness. More of her friends believing her wholeheartedly. More of her walls being broken down.
                    She wanted it. She wanted it more than she could bear, even if the very thought of dropping the
                    walls she used to keep her emotional difference was physically painful. Everything about her was
                    repulsed by the thought, even if when she had it had been met with trust and care and
                    <em> warmth - </em>
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She sighed. She hadn’t changed at all had she.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Last night had even shown her how easily they were knocked down. Both her own emotions and her
                    friends support shattering any resistance she could have put up. She’d felt herself slip back into
                    her old self, just for a moment.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    And all she felt was the conflict within her, one part wanting to wholeheartedly fall back into it,
                    let herself seek help again, let her friends be as close as possible. Let them see everything. Yet
                    the other part was horrified by the very idea, thinking they would be horrified, disgusted. That
                    they would think she was weak.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She squeezed her eyes shut, forcing herself to think.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It… it was obvious that it hadn’t been working. Hell, this was practically proof of that. They
                    seemed to actually care about her warnings this time. She actually had a leg to stand on with them
                    this time. One even the Incubator would have trouble undermining. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet she also didn’t feel like she could just go all in. She may not have changed as much as she
                    thought, but she knew she was different from the girl she used to be. Maybe not fundamentally, but
                    enough that she couldn’t just open up. Even back then she had had shields.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>A balancing act then.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She could do that.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Her life for the last… What, decade? All of it had been a balancing act. One she had survived. She
                    would just have to let herself trust them, and slowly lower her barriers.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>But… not right now. She couldn’t. Not till after-</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She winced. Considering how easily they’d lowered her barriers in a single day, saying not till
                    after Walpurgisnacht… wasn’t realistic.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She would need to prepare to be vulnerable. Would need to gather every advantage possible.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She would have to be ready to lose it all if things went wrong.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then she froze as suddenly a pair of arms wrapped around her, and pulled her up, causing her to
                    notice the ringing in her ears, and the fact that she still had her eyes screwed shut. She slowly
                    forced herself to open them again, finding herself looking into Sayaka’s blue eyes,
                    <em>blue as the labyrinth she creates</em>, she shook herself a bit, noticing Sayaka’s mouth moving,
                    even if she couldn’t hear a word past the ringing.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then Madoka startled her, the girl practically falling on top of her and holding her tight as well.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She slowly reached out after a moment, hands shaking. Then returned the hug.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was… obviously a little too late for those kinds of thoughts. She would just have to hope having
                    Madoka and Sayaka on her side was enough to tip the rest of the timeline in her favor.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>As her hearing came back through the panic, she heard Madoka asking. “Are you ok Homura?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura nodded. “I am now, thank you. I…” Her mouth hung open for a second, but she couldn’t think of
                    anything to say.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “It’s fine, feel free to come to us if you’re ever feeling down Homura. Hell, probably Hitomi too
                    once we tell her!” Sayaka exclaimed. Homura opened her mouth to argue but… Madoka had already told
                    Hitomi something was up.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Just as long as you are careful. The Incubator is tricky, and often likes to spy on people to
                    gather information. I would prefer that it knows nothing about me if possible.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Sayaka and Madoka nodded thoughtfully.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The morning after that progressed quickly, with all of them getting ready and then eating breakfast.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Junko Kaname was here now, and while she seemed to not quite be awake for a bit, she soon woke up,
                    and started asking questions. Nothing too in depth, she seemed profoundly smug for some reason, and
                    whenever she asked a question about Madoka, her answers seemed to be making the woman barely hold
                    back from laughter.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Hmm. She didn’t quite understand it, but she had a feeling it wasn’t ill intentioned. Didn’t have
                    the same bite her old bullies did, or Sayaka in most timelines.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She had no idea what was happening but… Her train of thought was already starting to be derailed.
                    Even while Kaname spoke.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… This was going to be a long day, wasn’t it.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>---</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka watched Homura carefully as they walked and met Hitomi before heading into school. Their
                    green haired friend seemed immensely curious, but it wasn’t too hard to quickly tell the girl that
                    they would talk about it later. Although the girl seemed to be acting a bit odd for some reason,
                    giving them looks-
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka rolled her eyes, and took Hitomi’s hand. “Just say you’re feeling left out next time Tomi.”
                    Hitomi blinked for a moment, then smiled, nodding.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Madoka immediately went back to watching Homura, and more notably, her ribbon.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    During the rest of the week since it had appeared, it had been fairly consistent. But now it was
                    changing rather significantly, shifting between White and black seemingly almost a little at random.
                    Yet there was a pattern. This morning, the breakdown last night, even occasionally on the walk here,
                    when Homura got stuck in her head the bond between them became more tinged with despair.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Yet when she showed she was there. Verbally or physically, the bond became more white.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was honestly slightly terrifying how much control she had over Homura’s mental state. Just how
                    much the girl obviously centered herself around her. If she was being honest, maybe to a bit of an
                    unhealthy degree. She had a feeling Homura would be willing to do anything for her, but she didn’t
                    want to push her into anything.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    As they went to school though, she noticed it more and more, Homura getting stuck in her own head
                    and having to look at her to seemingly confirm something with herself. Whether it made her ribbon
                    whiter or darker seemed actually random.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She pursed her lips. She knew Homura was worried about her contracting, and that meant…</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She needed to promise not to. Needed to make sure Homura would always be able to simply remind
                    herself of the promise and their current connection.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>But what would be good enough to do so…</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She blinked, as an idea came to her. Homura was a time traveler right? Which meant that she’d known
                    Madoka roughly only yesterday and after.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>And she had something she thought would symbolize her promise well.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Thankfully, this was one of the few days Hitomi didn’t have any extra classes, so after school they
                    were all dragged to Homura’s apartment again to hang out. Sayaka quickly explained all the important
                    parts while Homura prepared to go fight a witch. Madoka gulped at the thought, but after Sayaka
                    finished explaining everything important, Hitomi looked immensely interested and was staring at
                    Homura with interest, before asking to exchange phone numbers. Both she and Sayaka froze.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… whoops.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>After a moment to make sure they all had Homura’s phone number, Homura said she had to go now.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Madoka gathered her courage and stood up, walking over. Causing Homura to raise an eyebrow.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I… I know you’ve been worried about me contracting so… I want to promise you I won’t. Even give you
                    something to remind yourself if you ever get worried about me!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura looked shocked, but her bond also became a bit whiter. “That… that will not be necessary-”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka immediately shook her head. “You’ve been fighting to save me for a very long time. If I can’t
                    help you fight, I can at least give you some peace of mind!” She was ready to argue further, but
                    Homura just smiled softly for a moment before her face went blank again, and she nodded.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka reached up, untying her ribbons. Then walked over to Homura, who was as still as a statue as
                    Madoka took off the hair band and tied the red ribbons into her hair, until she took a step back,
                    looking at the gorgeous girl looking at her with eyes wide from shock. Countless emotions snapping
                    through that she couldn’t hope to catch. Tears even built up slightly at the corners for a moment
                    before she quickly wiped them away on her sleeve, and opened and closed her mouth a few times
                    speechlessly before finally settling on, “Thank You.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Madoka smiled, but then Homura frowned for a moment. </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Your pigtails…”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ah, it’s okay Homura! I have more pairs of ribbons at home!” She smiled, but Homura was still
                    frowning, eyes obviously deep in thought, before she held out her closed fist, and opened it to
                    reveal a pair of purple ribbons.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I… I know it's not much but… these are the ones I wore in… earlier timelines-” She immediately
                    threw herself at Homura, hugging her close. Before taking a step back and slowly grabbing the
                    ribbons. Then tying them into her hair.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“I’ll treasure them, Homura!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Now Homura really was smiling, bowing and going outside with the small, soft fragile smile not quite
                    faded yet.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    … “Well, well, well, someone sure is friendly with the transfer student.” She immediately turned
                    around, cheeks on fire as she looked back at Sayaka and Hitomi. Her blue haired friend with a smug
                    and entertained expression and Hitomi with a hand over her face as her shoulders shook.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>They weren’t very convinced by her rapid and fumbled denials.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    After Homura was gone though, they all headed for a nearby park for a bit, making sure to lock the
                    door behind them, and happily talking to each other about their hobbies and other happy,
                    lighthearted things.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Until they reached the park, and a girl in white frilly dress appeared, her relatively large figure
                    emphasized by the many, <em>many</em> green ribbons surrounding her.

                  <p>
                    Homura followed her patrol routes, checking locations where the garden witch often appeared.
                    Especially around this time. Her memory may not be perfect, and it didn’t always appear in the same
                    place, but it was a start. Especially since she hopefully didn’t have to worry about Tomoe knowing
                    about her already. Or at least only knowing her as some odd anomaly depending on if the Incubator
                    had told the other veteran about her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She put that minor issue to the side for the moment though. The Incubator currently had nothing
                    other than that it could hold against her, and potentially didn’t even consider her an actual
                    problem. At least, not one that warrants making Mami Tomoe consider her a threat. If she was lucky
                    she might even be able to get off with the Incubator not considering her a direct one, except
                    through being a magical girl in Mitakihara taking the pressure off Madoka to contract by dealing
                    with witches.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    There was nothing to do about that now, besides hope they didn’t run into it or any witches today.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It became hard to breathe as that thought stuck itself at the forefront. What if in this brief
                    moment she left them everything went wrong, and whatever anomaly that caused Madoka to have some
                    sort of power never appeared again? What if she had to go back so shortly after Madoka and Sayaka
                    became her friends again, and trusted her again?
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>
                      What if they were in danger right now? Kyubey taking the opportunity to pressure one of them into
                      making a contract at this very moment-
                    </em>
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura reached up, feeling the texture of the ribbon that had replaced her headband. Madoka had
                    <em> promised </em> her. She had even seemed confident in a way that resembled the timelines, oh so
                    few now, where Madoka contracted.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>At least before it all went wrong.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura would never let herself regret upholding her promise. Madoka didn’t deserve to be doomed like
                    the rest of them, and after <em> that </em> timeline she wouldn’t accept a different outcome. She
                    couldn’t.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    … She had always missed the Madoka’s from those first timelines. The one who cared for her, and was
                    self assured. The one who encouraged her when she had no one else. The one who saved her, over and
                    over, even at the cost of herself.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura still didn’t entirely understand why. After all, she wasn’t worth that. She wasn’t worth
                    anything really.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She cut down the train of thought. She couldn’t afford to stick around Madoka and her friends
                    twentyfour-seven, no matter how much she wanted to. She needed firepower and allies for
                    Walpurgisnacht. Especially since no matter how much firepower she threw at it, Walpurgisnacht barely
                    seemed fazed most of the time. Homura technically knew <em> why </em>, but there wasn’t much she
                    could do about it.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Walpurgisnacht was already one of the most powerful witches in existence, and she was hard to damage
                    with all but the most powerful of attacks by default. Not that that had stopped Homura from bringing
                    such force against Walpurgisnacht.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The problem though, was the barrier.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The one she could rarely break on her own, and even if she had, doing so took all of her amassed
                    munitions.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Walpurgisnacht didn’t even keep it up at all times, only doing so when at risk of considerable
                    damage. Homura had even accounted for it, and used blocked rockets to send Walpurgisnacht into areas
                    rigged with enough explosives to outpace even Tomoe’s offensive output in more than one timeline.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Yet it was never enough.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    If she could get Tomoe on her side, and maybe Kyoko Sakura as well… then she should have enough
                    firepower, maybe. But it was rare that Kyoko and Tomoe worked together for any length of time during
                    the loops.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    They rarely repaired their fractured friendship by themselves, and that wasn’t helped by their
                    morals, which had shifted ever so far apart. They tended to fight, and fall apart. Out of the few
                    times they did work together, ironically enough, it tended to be because of Sayaka.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>That may not be applicable this time though.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Honestly, it was hard to tell what was still applicable.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Before she could continue trying to plan around the changes of the timeline, her soul gem began
                    glowing brighter.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She frowned slightly, as she noticed her particular surroundings, and immediately ran to an
                    abandoned building in the area. Watching as her soul gem began glowing even brighter as she did.
                    Looks like she got lucky this time, the witch was here, and hopefully Mami- Tomoe wasn’t quite on
                    its trail yet since she hadn’t been called to it by The Incubator.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Then once the building was in line of sight, her eyes widened.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She immediately transformed, seeing the woman about to jump, and knowing immediately she wouldn’t
                    get there in time.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The very moment her shield formed, she forced it to twist, color draining away and becoming muted as
                    she hurried over, and quickly jumped to the top of the building, unstopping time right before
                    grabbing the woman by the back of her shirt and pulling her back from right as she was about to tip
                    off. Letting out a precise chop as she did and watching as the witch-kissed woman's consciousness
                    faded away.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She sighed slightly, grabbing the woman's shoes and lifting her, before jumping down to the ground,
                    and putting them on a nearby patch of grass.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Just as she was about to begin walking in though, she heard a bit of clapping from behind her,
                    causing her to whip around to a surprisingly not hostile Mami Tomoe in full magical girl regalia.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Well, I must thank you for protecting those in my territory. I don’t think I would have made it in
                    time, so it's good to know that a new magical girl in my territory is willing to waste magic to help
                    others.” The blonde haired girl said, a confident, fake smile on her face as she stared at Homura.
                    Even as her eyes had some caution in them.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura pursed her lips as she tried to figure out what to do for a moment. Before nodding slightly.
                    “Of course, if I can save witch-kissed victims I will do so.” Tomoe smiled a bit wider, guard still
                    not quite up, but obviously still cautious.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She couldn’t figure out what else to do though. Should she find a new witch? She had been hunting
                    this one, but she also wasn’t just going to turn her back on Tomoe. The girl might take that as a
                    blatant disregard for her claim on the territory, but what else could she do…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Before she could figure it out, Mami Tomoe spoke. “Hmm… would you like to hunt this witch with me
                    then so that it doesn’t try to claim any more?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura blinked.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    This… might be an opportunity. Granted, at least part of it was likely to get a grasp of her skills
                    and abilities, but it was still a chance to make a good impression.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She nodded. “That would be acceptable.” Mami’s face twitched slightly, Homura didn’t know what that
                    could mean though, so she didn’t say anything.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    At least The Incubator didn’t appear to be here at the moment, although whether that was good or bad
                    was hard to say.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>---</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami held back a wince at how formal this new magical girl was. She was tentatively hopeful, maybe
                    she could actually make a f- ally. It didn’t seem like this girl was the type to let familiars run
                    wild. Especially with how she actually used magic to save someone.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    <em> She remembered the look in those red eyes a year ago as Kyoko suggested- </em>
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mami immediately suppressed that memory. It didn’t matter at the moment.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She forced her smile to be a bit wider, as she realized that she didn’t even know the girl's name
                    yet. “Well then, I’m Mami Tomoe, and I look forward to working with you…?” She let the question hang
                    for a moment.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I’m Homura Akemi, and… likewise.” Akemi didn’t smile though, just staring blankly. For the briefest
                    of moments Mami thought she could see some emotion in Akemi’s purple eyes, before she turned towards
                    the building and began walking. Seemingly confident enough to turn her back on another magical girl
                    she just met, interesting. Mami wondered if the girl was reckless, or just that confident in her
                    abilities. “Let’s get moving, Tomoe-san.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She began moving forward as well, following after Akemi-san as they got closer to the entrance of
                    the witch's labyrinth. Wondering for a moment what questions to ask. She was pretty sure this girl
                    was the anomaly Kyubey didn’t remember contracting, but she seemed civil enough so far. She supposed
                    she should ask how long the girl had been around though, if Kyubey couldn’t remember contracting her
                    maybe she was from really far away? Kyubey obviously wasn’t everywhere, that would be silly! But
                    there were obviously witches in other places, not to mention magical girls, so there had to be other
                    forces too perhaps? “How long have you been fighting for Akemi-san?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Akemi seemed to think for a moment as Mami got into step with her. A moment that slowly became
                    several, and then more. Just as Mami was about to say something, Akemi finally spoke. “I… have been
                    a magical girl for a <em> very </em> long time.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami inwardly winced, seeing Homura’s mood visibly worsen. Then immediately thought about a possible
                    way to cheer her up and make her still possibly want to stay around afterwards. It was slightly hard
                    to tell how old the girl was, especially since now her eyes almost seemed to have a weight behind
                    them now. One that looked and felt like the ones only a handful of veterans she had seen before had
                    had. The ones older and more tired than herself. The ones who often just didn’t care anymore.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then she remembered the feeling of warmth roughly two years ago, as red eyes looked up to her in
                    admiration.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… It couldn’t hurt to try...?</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Well then, if you are really such an expert then maybe you have a few tips for me, Akemi-Senpai~?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Akemi almost tripped, then just looked at her, deeply confused, opening and closing her mouth a few
                    times.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Before either of them could say anything though, the entrance to the labyrinth appeared, and all
                    traces of confusion or other emotions disappeared in an instant as Akemi looked at the entrance to
                    the barrier. Replaced by pure focus.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    After a moment, the black haired magical girl pulled out- is that a real assault rifle!? Before she
                    could even blink, the girl had hopped through!
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami threw herself through after a brief moment, forming a musket and readying it as she found
                    herself within the warped space, cotton balls around, and one of the closest ones already full of
                    bullet holes as the assault rifle in Akemi’s hands fired at a rapid pace. Letting out a semi
                    familiar sound as it did.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She decided to put off finding out why Akemi had such a weapon for later, quickly firing at a
                    rapidly approaching familiar and forming another musket.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The labyrinth was rather large, but between the two of them familiars never even got close. A single
                    shot was practically all it took for her to deal with most of them, and while Akemi’s weapons were
                    less effective as a whole besides the occasional shotgun, her precision was exceedingly precise. To
                    the point that Mami really could easily believe that the girl was older and more experienced than
                    her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She smiled even through the fighting, keeping herself confident even as they carved their way into
                    the witches lair, and found themselves looking down at a giant plant-butterfly-witch.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Akemi seemed to think for a moment, before pulling out a sniper rifle, which began to glow with a
                    soft purple light after a moment. “I will cover you.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami nodded, jumping down, but staying on guard. She had no idea where Akemi got such a weapon, and
                    didn’t expect her to use it against her, but better to be safe than sorry. She Quickly got closer to
                    the witch, then did a curtsy, letting muskets fall out of her skirt. If the girl was going to watch
                    from above, then Mami would give her a show!
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She began methodically firing at the witch, firing a round from each musket before throwing it to
                    the side and then throwing it to the side, then pulling out more when she ran out. The witch
                    obviously didn’t just take it though, quickly flying into the air and trying to evade, but even Mami
                    winced when a bang rang out and a streak of purple slammed into its head. She masked it immediately
                    though, and kept firing- Before she could do anything more, a bunch of tiny fairy familiar things
                    began flying around her, binding her as they formed into a vine, and she was lifted up.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Before it could go far though, another bullet slammed through it a bit lower, cutting it, and
                    leaving her in freefall.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She took the opportunity, feeling for the power of the musket balls left in the witch, before
                    pulling on it, making them fall back into ribbons, and trapping the witch as she pulled from her
                    soul gem to form a large bundle of her signature gold thread.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Thread which was forced into the form of a large, silver barrel.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Tiro Finale!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She watched it slam into the witches' form, blasting a massive hole in it, and causing a grief seed
                    to fall to the ground and as the labyrinth began to fade away. Mami turned, watching Akemi walk over
                    to the grief seed, inspecting it for a moment. Before she could say anything, it was tossed her way.
                    Easily caught in her left hand.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I used very little magic in that labyrinth, and this is your territory, so you can keep this grief
                    seed.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami raised an eyebrow. “This grief seed? Does that mean you would like to work with me in the
                    future?” She hoped it did, but tried to temper her expectations.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I would… certainly appreciate being able to do so, yes. Especially since I will need all the help I
                    can get once Walpurgisnacht comes.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mami froze, halfway through putting the grief seed away.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Ah, that would certainly explain it, an experienced magical girl from far away who was hunting
                    Walpurgisnacht.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She smiled. “Well then! Why don’t we go to my home and have some tea while we talk over working
                    together Akemi-Senpai!~”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Akemi’s expression was odd, eyes wide and face twisting in confusion and… maybe something else?
                    Another thing it was though, was surprisingly cute compared to her normal blank expression.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“I… yes, let's go.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mami smiled.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She might have finally made a friend, even if she hadn’t quite expected to be the younger one.</p>

                    Homura followed Tomoe back to her apartment, not even sure how to attempt to explain the…
                    misunderstanding. Tomoe seemed to have decided she was an older magical girl, and Homura didn’t
                    quite know how to tell the girl she wasn’t without asking how old Tomoe was first to avoid
                    suspicion, and that could cause problems. She wasn’t entirely sure what combination of factors had
                    caused Mami to act so friendly towards her.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    … Did she need to say anything? Unless Tomoe brought something up, it wasn’t technically an issue.
                    Even if it was <em> unbelievably </em> weird to hear her former mentor call her senpai. Yet when it
                    came right down to it, this was possibly an opportunity to get the weak willed girl to listen to
                    her. To gain influence before Kyubey could start chiseling away at the foundation.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then she felt a telepathic connection from Tomoe. <em> ” </em>
                    <em>
                      Your experience really showed in that fight Senpai! You were making shots with ease that I'd
                      struggle with on my best day, and I consider myself a fine shooter.
                    </em>
                    <em> ” </em>
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura twitched slightly at being called senpai, then blinked, hearing the oddly respectful tone
                    through the telepathy. She shrugged it off after a moment. She wasn’t here to have her skill
                    complimented, she was here to gain an ally. So she would make sure Tomoe liked her.
                    <em>

                    Homura tensed slightly, Tomoe was always a bit odd about her gathering of weapons. She would have to
                    be careful.

                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura sighed, relieved. Tomoe really did seem understanding.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then she blinked. When had she grown so relieved by things Tomoe herself had pushed her to look into
                    countless timelines ago? She shook herself mentally. Tomoe… Mami was many things. Fragile,
                    misguided, and lonely. But she wasn’t as prone to doubling down on calling others' problems unless
                    they tried to stop her from abating her loneliness. Which Homura often had to do due to the
                    Incubator’s constant attempts to contract Madoka and Sayaka, who Mami often latched on to.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    But even then, Mami often attempted to offer some semblance of allyship even in timelines where
                    things broke down between them, even if it was always with obvious distrust.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Now Homura was forced to wonder…</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Would Mami latch on to her?</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She disregarded the possibility after a moment, the Incubator would probably stop such an event from
                    happening in the long term. Not to mention that she didn’t like her chances of keeping Madoka and
                    Sayaka away from Mami long term, and she would probably latch on to them then, even if they told her
                    flat out they weren’t planning on wishing.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura cut off the train of thought, it didn’t matter, as long as Mami could listen to someone.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It didn’t matter if it stung, or whether she had wished on occasion that the blonde haired girl
                    would hold her hand.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami was starting to look back at her now, so she spoke through the connection.
                    <em>
                      ”It’s good to know I’m not the only one. Given our similar fighting styles, I should be able to

                  <p>
                    Then a bit of laughter came from Mami’s side of the connection.
                    <em> ”Well you’re very formal aren’t you~.” </em>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    It… didn’t sound like a question. It had been a long time since she’d been on the other end of
                    Mami’s teasing tone as well.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>How odd.</p>
                  <p> </p>

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Before Mami could respond though, they finally made it to her apartment, causing them to both drop
                    their transformation after they jumped down, and left Homura to follow Mami through when she opened
                    the door.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She attempted to brutally suppress the memories that threatened to rise up as she entered. Memories
                    of more naive, happier times. Times with Madoka and Mami, Sayaka, and even Kyoko on occasion. Times
                    back when they all hung out together. Some of the few happy memories she had.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    They weren’t all though of course. There were many where she entered this apartment for… less
                    enjoyable reasons.

                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Her left hand shot up to her ribbon again, feeling it and letting it serve as a reminder again.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She cursed herself, twice in one day she was so weak that she used Madoka’s ribbon to break herself
                    out of her thoughts. She couldn’t afford to be so weak. Her friends died when she was too weak to
                    help them.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… It was nice using it as a reminder of Madoka’s promise though.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mami seemed to notice though, a look of concern on her face. “Are you alright?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She nodded. “Yes, I am fine now, just got caught up in some memories.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami smiled. “Alright then, why don’t you sit down at the table then, I’ll go prepare some
                    refreshments!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura didn’t bother trying to deter her, just moving to the table and sitting down until Mami came
                    back from the kitchen after a few minutes with tea and cake. Homura quickly thanked the girl, then
                    she took a sip of the tea.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She let out a small noise of satisfaction, causing Mami to preen slightly. Homura felt her mouth
                    twitch upwards. It had been a long time since she tasted Mami’s tea, and the girl really was quite
                    good at making it. It did feel a bit odd for the girl to seem so happy that she in particular was
                    satisfied, but not necessarily in a bad way.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The cake was similarly good, and for a brief moment, she remembered how it felt when Madoka
                    encouraged her, back in the very first timeline. Remembered Mami giving her input and telling her
                    when she did well.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>…</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “This food and drink is very good, did you make it yourself Tomoe-san?” She asked, already knowing
                    the answer, but if Mami was going to call her senpai, she might as well try to fulfill that role.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mami was practically glowing from her compliment. “I do! I haven’t had many chances to share it with
                    others though… Which reminds me, if we are going to be working together, would it be alright if we
                    used our first names?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura wanted to say no, every last instinct from past timelines screaming that she couldn’t get
                    close again. Couldn’t let herself get hurt when things inevitably went wrong.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… But Madoka and Sayaka were already close, and they <em> listened to her. </em></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She could see how being close allowed her more influence with them-</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She cursed herself again. Now she was thinking like the Incubator.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She closed her eyes for a moment, already knowing she had decided. Even if Mami was the most fragile
                    and least informed.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“That… would be acceptable Mami-san.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mami’s smile somehow got bigger when she said that.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Well then Homura-senpai, shall we talk about Walpurgisnacht?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura nodded, even as she kept herself from reacting to Mami saying her name.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The resulting talk took a bit, but Mami’s face became serious as soon as they switched to the topic,
                    looking more and more concerned as Homura went over how it would be appearing within a month, and
                    how dangerous the witch was.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    By the time she was done going over all of the important information regarding the witch, Mami
                    nodded, and held out her hand.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura took it.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mami smiled again. “Well then Homura-senpai, I hope we’ll work together well!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura nodded. “I hope for the same.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    After that though, she had to leave. Mami was a little disappointed of course, but it was obviously
                    tempered by not knowing Homura.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>So after they exchanged goodbyes, Homura got on the nearest bus, and began texting Madoka.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… Yet she didn’t receive an answer.</p>

                  <p>
                    Madoka tensed slightly as the magical girl appeared in front of her. She didn’t really know what was
                    going on, but the girl was practically leaking green ribbons. Most of them were thin and faint, but
                    there were so many… It was concerning.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Why was this girl so disliked?</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>And why had she appeared in front of them?</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Sayaka spoke up first, looking cautious. “What's up?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The girl in front of them smiled serenely. “Well, I’m Oriko Mikuni, and I happened to want to talk
                    with all of you about some important matters. Would that be alright?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka glanced at her friends nervously. Sayaka was still cautious, but her interest in the magical
                    girl seemed to be overrunning it quickly. Hitomi on the other hand just smiled back, and stepped
                    forward slightly. “I’m Hitomi Shizuki, would a nearby bench be fine?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mikuni nodded, as they all began walking to the nearest bench in the park. Madoka decided to put her
                    concern to the side for now. It was a bit fast to be meeting another magical girl, and Homura had
                    told them other magical girls could be territorial, to the point that apparently whoever Mami was
                    often thought Homura was just trying to stop them from contracting for personal gain most of the
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    But at the same time, she hadn’t really done anything yet besides try to talk to them. The amount of
                    people that disliked her was concerning, but Madoka didn’t have any context. Though now that she was
                    looking there were only two relatively large big green ones. One was slightly green, but tinged with
                    yellow, and a couple other colors, and was the second thickest of the green threads.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The second was more concerning.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She recognized it after all.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was the bright green and grey ribbon that came from Homura, shredded and barely attempting to
                    hold itself together. The fact that Homura hated this girl so much immediately made her cautious
                    again. Not to mention the smaller ribbon wrapped into it, threaded with blue. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Why would she be scared of Homura?</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She still didn’t know anything about her, or why Homura hated her. At least if Homura hadn’t
                    mentioned her it was likely something personal, right? Still, the least she could do at the moment
                    was introduce herself. “Um, I’m Madoka Kaname.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka was quick to follow up with, “And I’m Sayaka Miki!” right as they sat down, causing Mikuni’s
                    smile to grow slightly as she nodded at them.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Now that introductions are over, I suppose we should just get down to business.” Her white frilly
                    dress disappeared, being replaced by a much less conspicuous school uniform. “As you likely know,
                    I’m a magical girl.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Sayaka nodded. “Yeah, we know what magical girls are, and what they do.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mikuni’s green eyes looked at all of them for a moment. “That makes this easy then, as due to my
                    wish I can see the future.” Madoka’s eyes went wide, shock lancing through her. She realized she
                    hadn’t even looked to see if the girl had any connections with any of them. She looked through her
                    own connections, quickly realizing there was one she hadn’t really noticed due to being relatively
                    small and out of sight. A faint orange one.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mikuni… respected her?</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The other two’s threads were practically still colorless though.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then Mikuni continued. “That may be hard to believe, but I bring this up as a powerful witch will
                    come to Mitakihara in about a month, and honestly… I will need a rather significant amount of allies
                    to fight it. My visions have shown that you can gather quite a few magical girls to help.” The
                    blonde girl's green eyes stared specifically at her with that last sentence, with a passing glance
                    at Sayaka.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka was honestly still shocked though. Could it be because of her ability? Was she able to bring
                    enough people together using it? Or was it something else?
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Either way, the chance to help save Mitakihara without breaking her promise to Homura sounded
                    amazing! She could help everyone in the city, and make it so that Homura had people who could help
                    her!
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She smiled. “I would be happy to help!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Sayaka leapt up. “Me too!” </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Hitomi just giggled slightly, staring at them for a moment before nodding.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Mikuni replied. “Well then, I hope we all get along and work together well, and I’m sorry for
                    interrupting what you were doing. If it's alright I would like to exchange numbers, and then we can
                    arrange a more formal meeting for when you aren’t in the middle of something.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka frowned, but before she could say anything Sayaka spoke up. “Why don’t you come with us! We
                    could go hang out at the mall or arcade for a bit, and have some fun!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ah, while the invitation is nice Miki-san, I am not very well versed in such activities, and I
                    doubt you would really want someone you just met coming along-”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Before she could even finish, Sayaka interrupted her. “Firstly, feel free to call me Sayaka.
                    Secondly, that just means we <em> have </em> to bring you! Come on!” 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Before Oriko could say another word through her shock, Sayaka got up, moved around to Oriko’s side,
                    and began pushing the girl in the direction of the mall. Oriko just seemed to be confusedly allowing
                    it, unsure what to do.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka shared a glance with Hitomi, before giggling at Sayaka’s antics and following them. Turning
                    her phone on silent for all but her parents numbers so that it wouldn't interrupt anything.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    It was actually relatively nice actually. As they continued talking about their interests and some
                    things that had happened recently while doing their best to include Oriko, who was a bit more
                    awkward now, seemingly unsure how to act. Evidently trying to keep up with their conversation
                    though, even if they didn’t quite understand some of the stuff she talked about. Especially when it
                    came to her favorite book. But before they could discuss it, Sayaka dragged them into an arcade.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    They ended up splitting up, Sayaka seeing a game she wanted to play and Hitomi following with a
                    smile. That left her with the surprisingly nervous Oriko.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Which was when she noticed a machine of Mario Kart.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                     “Oh! Why don’t you come play this with me?” She walked over to the game, Oriko awkwardly following
                    behind and sitting in the other seat as put in a few quarters. The blonde haired girl seemed to
                    struggle with the controls at first, so Madoka made sure to tell her the basics, even if she wasn’t
                    the most amazing at video games. Thankfully Oriko seemed to get it quickly, choosing Rosalina while
                    Madoka chose Peach.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The first few races just seemed to make Oriko frustrated as she tried and failed to win, after that
                    though she started doing better, before managing to win a race against her!
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Congratulations on beating me! You’ve gotten pretty good already!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Oriko smiled under the praise. “Thank you, although I’m unsure it’s really fair given my magical
                    girl reflexes.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Madoka immediately got into her face.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                     “So what if it is? It may not be fair, but people are all different anyways, so if you are
                    naturally good at something it's better to accept it then put yourself down!”
                    <em> Even if she wasn’t amazing at it herself yet- </em> She ignored the quiet thought. Sayaka and
                    Hitomi both thought she was amazing, and she was! Even if it was hard to remember sometimes.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then she noticed she was still in Oriko’s face, who was still looking at her oddly shocked. Madoka
                    immediately jumped backwards, apologizing profusely, which Oriko waved off with a smile after a
                    moment.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The rest of the day was pretty fun, as they bounced between machines, meeting up with their friends
                    and occasionally joining up or falling apart into different groups. Eventually got late, and they
                    had to go.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>They walked out of the mall and down a sidewalk until Oriko’s ring started glowing.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Uh oh.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    They looked at each other with concerned looks as Oriko’s expression turned grim, forming her soul
                    gem into its egg shaped form and following it into a nearby alley. Looking pained.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>After a few moments, Sayaka spoke up. “Uh, you gonna go and deal with the witch?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Oriko sighed. “This appears to actually be a familiar’s labyrinth, however I am not sure it would be
                    wise for me to attempt to fight it.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Now Sayaka seemed a little incensed. “What!? Why not fight it if it's going to hurt people!?”</p>
                  <p>
                    <br /><br />Oriko looked away for several seconds before speaking. “I… Am not all that effective in
                    a fight normally. While I would love to take care of it, the lack of grief seed would leave me with
                    next to no magic, and... Very vulnerable.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Madoka winced, that was… a good point. Especially since she was pretty sure Oriko was avoiding the
                    real reason, that she would become a witch.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka looked a little chastised, but still frustrated. Kicking a nearby dumpster, and yelling out.
                    “DAMMIT!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, without a sound, Homura suddenly appeared. Madoka noticed her ribbons in a bow tie for her
                    collar and a hairband in the obviously magical outfit. Homura’s face contorted into an angry, cold
                    expression.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>While holding a gun with a long barrel pointed directly at Oriko’s head</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Explain what you are doing here Oriko Mikuni, before I kill you.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Something in Madoka’s stomach dropped, fear taking over as the time traveler who was trying to save
                    her threatened her new friend.

                      could be wrong, but she was pretty sure Madoka already had some feelings of her own for Homura.

                      suicide, but if she was then… Hitomi wasn’t sure how they would advance further. Especially given

                      wasn’t exactly perceptive. In fact, he was mostly focused on his violin before his recent

                      bullying problem when she was younger and prevented any similar things as she got older. Although

                      sure it was fully resolved, and she hoped that Madoka knew she was there for her if she needed

                      whenever she got the chance. Granted, if someone else grabbed it first she usually let them have
                      it. Madoka was fast though, so the fact that she was instead sitting on the floor next to Homura

                      about magical girls and their hardships. How cold the world could be, and how it could screw
                      others over. As much as she hated to even think of it, she was pretty sure Madoka blamed herself
                      for what happened to Homura, too. Mami… well, Sayaka didn’t know much about her yet—they’d
                      basically just met after all. But from what Homura had said, the girl could use some friends, so
                      Sayaka would be hers! It certainly helped that Mami had given them such a great nickname to call
                      Homura!</span

                      really know what to do if one of her friends died. She didn’t know how she would feel, but it
                      wouldn't be anything pleasant. Homura had been through those feelings countless times, and was
                      somehow still going even as she fought witches, went to school, and tried to… Well, she wasn’t
                      quite certain what they had been to each other in other timelines. Considering Homura’s reaction

                      Sayaka didn’t point it out, though. It was funny seeing her odd expressions every time they called
                      her ‘senpai’, too. It was probably pretty weird for Homura considering she was pretty sure it

                      stood above the rest in her mind: wishing to heal Kyousuke’s hand. Which meant… Homura might know
                      about her feelings for Kyousuke. To make things worse, the girl had a point. Homura and Hitomi

                  <p>
                    Oriko sipped tea as she waited in the park, having sent the invite early that day. Akemi should be
                    coming soon, and… she had to calm her nerves.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She'd told Kirika to go hunt witches after school too, which meant this was going to be one on one.
                    Of course, she’d said she was open to any of the others coming as well but…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Akemi had refused that offer. And Oriko didn’t plan to antagonize the girl by having Kirika nearby.
                    She may be comforting, but at the moment she needed Akemi to feel like this wasn’t some sort of
                    trick or trap. Not that she was sure if such a thing would work without perhaps Tomoe’s help.
                    However, that was an educated guess at the moment, and while she deeply wanted to know more about
                    her current allies abilities, Akemi was too twitchy when it came to her. Better to not think about
                    it anymore and end up looking more suspicious in the girl's eyes. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    As she finished the cup and considered whether it was worth it to pour another from the thermos, she
                    heard something. Ah, Homura was...
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She blinked as she heard crying.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Oriko turned to a small green haired crying girl who was peeking out of the bushes. Which was… odd.
                    She had chosen this place because it was rather between Kazamino and Mitakihara, and as such it was
                    considered somewhat of a nebulous area when it came to territory. Not quite claimed by either Mami
                    Tomoe or Kyoko Sakura, but too close to both for any magical girl to comfortably hunt witches or
                    mark out a territory without a fight. Not to mention that the only thing relatively nearby was…
                    housing. Yet this girl was here, seemingly alone.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>"I'm… sorry…" The girl said, moving to walk away. </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She smiled at the girl, even as she turned her eyes slightly to look for a parent that didn't seem
                    to be around. Odd. "Feel free to be my guest, this is a public place. Why don’t you have a seat?"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The girl stared for a moment, before walking over and sitting down. Sipping some tea from her
                    thermos cap when offered and slowly calming down. Nervousness washing away.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>"Hello, Mikuni-san."</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Oriko barely managed to keep herself from flinching as she turned to Homura Akemi, who was giving
                    them a cautious but confused look. Honestly, given the last times outright deadly hostility, this
                    was several steps up. Even if she wasn’t sure exactly why. "Hello Akemi-san… I… Well, I planned to
                    talk about business and potentially some… other matters. However, I have gotten a surprise guest.
                    Uh, what's your name?"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The young girl stared up at them, seeming nervous again. But after a moment she murmured out: "My
                    name's Yuma…"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Akemi sighed, but nodded as she sat down. "What are you doing out here?"</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The girl's eyes became a little darker as she replied. "... Mommy was mad… she told me to leave and
                    never come back…"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Oriko had to swallow a bit of horror at that. Homura's expression became grim as she listened.
                    Although not at her, which was a good thing.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>"I see…" Akemi replied as she stared ahead.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    They continued listening as Yuma spoke. "It's because… I'm a bad, bad girl. That's why she gets mad,
                    I think. I guess she doesn’t want me."
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Once the girl was done though… she spoke up. "I… have never been scolded by my parents…" Akemi's
                    intense gaze refocused entirely on her, sending a shiver down her spine. Still, she didn't let that
                    dissuade her. "But… I have never thought of myself as a 'good girl'. I think trying to be one is
                    important of course, but…"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    For a moment, she can feel an answer on the tip of her tongue. One she had ruminated about on more
                    than one occasion. But even as she did…
                    <em
                      >A pink haired girl, giving her a kind smile and encouraging her. A flash of pink as the girl

                    >

                  <p>
                    "... I think… it is very difficult to truly be a 'good girl'. Calling yourself one is a mark of
                    conceit, but… It isn't impossible to be one. But even then, humans are fundamentally flawed. Even
                    'good girls' need help, and can make mistakes."
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Then she looked down at Yuma… who just seemed confused.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… Ah, maybe she… wasn’t suited for conversations with younger children.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    As she was about to try and clarify herself though, she looked up at Akemi who was… just staring at
                    her. She couldn’t pinpoint the emotion behind it, but the girl had obviously paid a bit more
                    attention than Yuma. Given the expression was neutral, she was willing to take it as a positive
                    impression.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    As Yuma said thank you, she froze, seeming unsure what to do. "I… does that mean I should go try to
                    be a good girl for mommy?"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Oriko blinked, before trying to think about it. The situation… didn’t sound good. But neither of
                    them could likely do anything about it. It would be better to send Yuma back to her mother so she
                    could be cared for. Not to mention that they really did need to have their talk, and it was not one
                    a child should be privy to.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    As she opened her mouth though, Yuma staring at her, Akemi’s face seemed to narrow in thought and…
                    suspicion? Oh no, what had she done wrong? As she tried to figure it out though, Akemi moved a hand
                    behind the smaller girl's head. A small purple glow appeared for just a moment before the girl
                    almost flinched back.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>

                  <p>
                    Oriko barely managed not to nod.

                  <p>
                    Homura took a breath as Yuma looked between them with a confused expression.
                    <em>"Her foreheads covered in cigarette burns under her bangs."</em>
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>… *oh*...</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She took a shaky breath, then nodded. "I… You should come with us for a bit, okay?"</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Yuma stared at her confusedly. "But… aren't I a bad girl? Why would you want a girl like me with
                    you?"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She forced herself to smile at the girl. "Because I don't think you are that bad of a girl. Not to
                    mention… I'm a far worse one. So how about we go get some food?"
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The way the girl's stomach rumbled at that only made her more worried, but thankfully after a moment
                    the girl smiled and nodded. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    As she got up though, she realized she'd put them in a predicament. If they went to her home, it
                    would likely make Akemi suspicious all over again. And if they went to Akemi’s, it could be taken as
                    an attempt to learn more about the girl.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>

                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The black haired girl's lips became a thin line. "... Follow me."</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Oriko and Yuma nodded, and she felt relief flow through her as the other girl took charge.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p> </p>

                      because of Yuma. It… wasn’t surprising, but it was concerning. As was most of the information she
                      knew about Akemi. Still, she took the opportunity to hold up her menu as a slight barrier between
                      her and the girl who could kill her with no effort… Not that such a thought did anything but make
                      her want to shift as anxiety shot through her nerves. She didn’t allow herself to show that
                      though. Couldn’t even, in the face of someone so central to the person she wanted to help yet so
                      untrusting of her.</span

                      had… been a while since the last time. Even then, it had been with her father. Now she was doing
                      it with two girls, one who was roughly her age and one who was younger. Neither of whom she had

                      to working with them as a team. Especially since she had gone back in time so many times… she
                      really wanted to hold the girl close, but now wasn’t a great time to do so. They couldn’t get

                      potentially best option is to simply… leave it to the adults. Madoka’s parents are likely more
                      than willing to help get the girl legally away from her mother, and from there we can focus on
                      preparing for Walpurgisnacht. We will not have much time as is, let alone to take care of another
                      girl." After that, Homura went over the various other options, but Madoka had to admit that Homura
                      had a point, so why was she still...?</span

                      in danger of becoming a witch.”</span

                      just… tell him then?” Homura nodded, and Sayaka wilted a little in uncertainty and disappointment
                      before continuing. “So… I have a few other questions I’d like to ask then. If you’re
                      willing.”</span

                  <p>
                    Sayaka thought about what she had learned. She had never actually gotten her feelings across to
                    Kyousuke as far as Homura knew, and she had a rival who had managed to get up the courage. Something
                    she was surprised by, even if she really shouldn’t be. It was the most obvious thing in the world in
                    hindsight really, even if she didn’t like it. Her friend was incredibly talented and amazing and-
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She cut herself off, more importantly was that she had a rival… Who Homura hadn’t said the name of.
                    Weird. “Who is the other girl confessing to him?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura frowned, seeming uncertain. “Are you sure you want to know? I am… admittedly not the most
                    certain when it comes to things like these where relationships and social constructs are involved.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    That made sense, even if it was a little sad that Homura didn’t trust her own judgment about things
                    like this that much. She would have to figure out how to try and help with that, later at least.
                    “Eh, it’ll be fine! Now tell me before I need to become your senpai Homura-senpai!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura’s face immediately became stony. “That will <em> not </em>be necessary…” The black haired
                    girl stopped talking for a moment, staring before slowly continuing. “... Kouhai.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka stopped for a moment in shock at Homura playing along, before cackling. “Ah yes, truly
                    accepting your role aren’t you as all of our senpai aren’t you oh Homura Senpai!~” She teased
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura’s eyes rolled at her antics, which only deepened her laughter. Once she was finally calming
                    down though, Homura spoke again. “Well, the other girl who is interested in Kamijou is Hitomi.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    For a moment she just blinked, processing what her friend had said. When it finally hit her, she
                    wasn’t even sure what to say. Emotions running through her in strange and twisty ways, it was
                    incredibly uncomfortable and made her want to look in any other direction. She wanted to say
                    something, yell something, but wasn’t sure what. Homura wouldn’t lie about something like this.
                    She’d said the girl had offered her the chance to confess first too and…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She laid back, shifting so her back spread across the couch as she stared up at Homura’s too white
                    ceiling. “Well that’s… A thing… I…” What did you even say to something like that?
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura stayed silent for a moment, before slowly speaking up. “I will remind you that she never knew
                    about magical girls and such things in previous timelines. She had no idea you made a wish for him,
                    or what you were going through at the time. Something you did not help with due to refusing to bring
                    up your reservations.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka winced, but… that was a good point. Even if it still felt like her love life just became far
                    more complicated than it had any right to be. “... And let me guess, your suggestion is to talk to
                    her?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Her friend’s mouth twitched slightly downwards. “I suppose? I… Don’t really have any further advice
                    for you when it comes to something like this. My main suggestion would actually be some sort of duel
                    to decide who gets to confess first.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka blinked, turning to Homura in complete disbelief. Homura didn’t meet her eyes for very long
                    before looking away, but seemed completely serious. Which was just…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Y’know what? After a couple more questions we’re going to an arcade or something. We’re getting you
                    some actual interaction with other people in normal because… a duel seems a bit over dramatic
                    Senpai.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura’s face turned a little red at that, but she slowly nodded. Something which made her smile a
                    little. Right before-
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “Wait! Does that mean Madoka knows!?” Homura just shrugged at her question, making her wince as she
                    remembered. “Right, sorry, that’s a new thing for you apparently. But still! Was I the last one to
                    know about this situation!?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“I think that would actually be Kamijuo.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Sayaka groaned. “That’s not helping!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura pulled herself back a bit, looking away awkwardly.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    After a moment to think, wracking her mind for more questions after she was so distracted, one came
                    to mind. “So, what's our relationship like in other timelines?”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura’s expression became unreadable at that, completely blank like when she had first seen the
                    girl as she introduced herself to the class on the day she transferred in. Purple eyes staring at
                    her without a hint of what was going on in her friend's head. Something which was probably a pretty
                    bad sign.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    After a moment Homura spoke, voice controlled to the point of being monotone. “In past timelines our
                    friendship was infrequent, and we were basically never close. In the earliest timeline you helped me
                    by providing notes and you were kind, but in the timelines where we were magical girls after that
                    you only considered me in any sort of serious capacity when it came to my weapons. You weren’t
                    hostile, and you were friendly, but it was also awkward. And then after…” The girl's expression
                    became pained for the briefest moment before it shifted back to blank. “After I learned the truth of
                    magical girls, you rarely trusted me again. Not if you knew about magic. One of the times we were
                    closest was during the timeline where Oriko attacked, and I didn’t stay after that. In fact, often
                    you would be absolutely willing to attack me if you thought you could win. But even when you aren’t
                    a magical girl you tend to be accusatory and distrustful of me, not that I usually gave you much
                    reason not to.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka felt cold at that, like she’d been hit by a wave of frigid sea water as connections formed in
                    her mind. Her former feelings about the situation with Kyousuke drowned under horror and
                    understanding. Why the girl was acting almost unconnected while speaking about such things, and how
                    she generally acted.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“And through all of it, you still cared didn’t you.” It wasn’t even a question.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura looked away at that once more, not responding to her. Not <em> denying </em> it. That she
                    had…
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    She slowly bowed, feeling utterly dejected and frustrated with herself. She wanted to punch herself
                    in the face, but this would do for now. “I’m sorry that I haven’t been a good friend to you, you
                    deserved better than that. You <em> deserve </em> better than that.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Her friend's expression became frustrated and almost exhausted as she sat up again. “I- That’s not
                    necessary. I’m no hero, nothing I do is for selfless reasons. And as I said, I gave you no reason to
                    trust me in basically all the past timelines. I was a random suspicious interloper who was often
                    caught attacking the small animal that said it could grant you a wish, and who wanted you to not
                    make that wish. Wouldn’t explain why. I have not been particularly kind to you either in many of
                    those timelines.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Some deep part of her ached, causing her to take a shaky breath before walking over and sitting next
                    to Homura. Her friend-could she really consider herself Homura’s friend?-tensing for a moment as she
                    wrapped an arm around her. “You never gave up on us though, did you.”<br /><br />Homura’s expression
                    became practically wrathful at that, face becoming red as a tear ran down her cheek. “I’d given up
                    on all of you except Madoka! No matter how hard I tried, the only one who tended to survive the
                    month was Kyoko, and she is focused on her own survival over most other things in the majority of
                    timelines! I’ve seen you all die over and over and you just… I… I… So often… you became lost causes.
                    Nothing I could do could pull you back from the edge. I could never save any of you!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka shivered, the blunt admittance chilling her to the bone like the water had frozen over.
                    Still, she stayed where she was as she noted Homura’s wording. “... Did you give up on us after
                    things happened in a timeline, or just in general.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura was silent for a moment, body quaking a little under the force of her emotions. “Both on some
                    level. I gave up hope that I could save you, and usually gave up trying after you contracted.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    That stung, her own eyes tearing up a bit. Homura was becoming more personal, talking about her
                    specifically, and it hurt. This girl was powerful and experienced, yet had given up hope on even
                    keeping her alive. But at the same time… she hugged Homura tighter against her, something her friend
                    seemed really confused by. “Yet even after you gave up hope on me, gave up trying when you didn’t
                    think there was a way to keep me alive in whatever timeline, you still kept trying to save me.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    The girl at her side froze at that, seeming shocked. Sayaka wasn’t sure exactly whether it was her
                    pointing it out that did it, or whether Homura hadn’t thought of it that way until now. Didn't
                    really want to know either.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I think that even if you hadn’t you would still be a hero. To me at least. I don’t think I would
                    even be sane if I was in your shoes!” She ignored a mutter that sounded concerningly like ‘I never
                    claimed I was sane.’ “Even if you think your actions are selfish-in fact, whether or not they
                    are-you’re <em> still </em> trying to save us! And I think that still makes you a hero!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Homura was staring at her again, expression shocked and frustrated-oh.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“... I talked a lot about being a hero when it comes to being a magical girl didn’t I?”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura seemed stunned for a moment, before slowly nodding. “Yes. Between not living up to your own
                    standards of heroism, the knowledge of soul gems making you call yourself a zombie, the incident
                    with Hitomi and Kamijou, and other factors, you basically never survive to Walpurgisnacht if you
                    become a magical girl. Your worldview just… can’t hold up, which is exceptionally dangerous for
                    magical girls.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Sayaka swallowed. “Well then… I… I’m not sure what to say about that honestly. But… I think I can
                    understand why you don’t like being called a hero now. I still think you’re amazing, and that you’re
                    being too hard on yourself. Maybe… maybe you tried to stay distant, but I think that’s okay. You can
                    only take so much. I know you now though, and I want to know you better. So maybe let's… well, not
                    restart, but forgive each other. We’ll become better friends, closer friends, besties even!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura didn’t seem to know how to respond to that, staying silent in shock with tear stained cheeks
                    before finally sighing. “I… fine. I will try.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Sayaka smiled as she wrapped her other arm around her friend for a couple seconds, before pulling
                    back and grabbing Homura’s hand. Pulling her out of her seat. 
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Wait, what are you-”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “As I said earlier, we’re going to hangout! Like normal teenagers our age who don’t have to deal
                    with weird magical stuff.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura looked ready to argue for a moment, winding up for a retort. Probably either because of the
                    emotional nature of the conversation or how late it had gotten. Sayaka didn’t give her the chance,
                    even if the method was a little mean.
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “If you don't, that would mean Oriko has spent more time being a normal teenager in this timeline,
                    and she had never been inside an arcade before!”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura’s offense was palpable, but the bit of resistance from before stopped. “Considering I have
                    actually been inside an arcade I think I beat her there rather easily.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Oh? You didn’t strike me as the type to be interested in video games.”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    “I’m not particularly invested in them, some of the ones I've played have been fun but during the
                    loops I haven’t had the time to waste. The last of our friend group however can often be found in
                    arcades.”
                  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>“Well then it’s time to relax and waste time! Having a bit of fun is good for you!”</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>
                    Homura’s eyes rolled, but she semi-easily fell into bantering with her as they walked through the
                    city. Both of them getting distracted from the topics from the questioning, if only for a while.

                      to be brought into any situation that didn’t serve some form of purpose. Well, besides with Madoka
                      on occasion, but that was more because… She had never been able to say no to Madoka, not easily at

                      being around Madoka made her feel safe and warm in a way she could never really describe, and that
                      nothing else made her feel that way. Even after all these loops nobody else had been able to make

                      timelines, if less of one. She would heal, and continue on with her life safely. An outcome far
                      more acceptable than the grand total of nothing Homura had managed so far- “Hey, what’s going on
                      in that head of yours Tick Tock-senpai?” Sayaka said, face way, way too close.</span

                      had stopped paying attention. After a moment of cursing herself for her lack of attention and
                      Sayaka clearly holding back laughter at her reaction. “I… nothing that bears repeating. I

                      it to keep Madoka safe, and while this wasn’t exactly a direct part of that, Sayaka seemed to

                      sang through the song, obviously invested. The longer it went on the more she felt herself being

                      forever until you either die or run out of magic. And… don’t run out of magic.” The girl visibly

                      confident in the idea. Even if she was also annoyed, and wanted to do it just because she was free
                      now and nobody could tell her what to do. “I’m… I’m going to wish for the best cheesecake in the
                      world, then give it to my Mom. I… I want her to know that I could have saved her, but wished for

                      everything! That I should just kill everyone! I… I want to be happy!” Once she started, the rest
                      just spilled out, emotions boiling over and leaving her shaking from their intensity. Her eyes

                      Settlers of Catan didn’t sound all that interesting, even if she knew not to ‘judge a book by its
                      cover’ that didn’t help the fact that it sounded boring.</span

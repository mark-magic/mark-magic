## Introduction

A data connection and transformation tool based on Markdown, addressing data conversion between different tools and facilitating coordination between certain commonly used tools.

Some use cases:

1.  Publishing notes online, such as generating content from Joplin note tool for a Hexo blog to publish on the web [here](https://blog.rxliuli.com/).
2.  Publishing a novel online, such as generating a novel website from local Markdown files for publication [here](https://tts.liuli.moe/).
3.  Packaging a novel into an EPUB file, such as packaging "To the Stars" into an EPUB for easy offline reading [here](https://github.com/liuli-moe/to-the-stars/releases).

Some previous community use cases:

1.  Joplin => Hugo to generate a blog.
2.  Joplin => Jekyll to generate a blog.
3.  Possibly others...

## Why not use existing tools

We have already used many tools for different tasks, but they are all based on Markdown, such as:

- Using Joplin to take notes.
- Using Hexo to write blogs.
- Using Vitepress to generate documentation websites.
- Using Docusaurus to generate SEO-friendly novel websites.
- Using Pandoc to generate EPUBs.

What really bothers us is when using Docusaurus, each novel requires a lot of configuration, which is very annoying. Therefore, we hope to have a better out-of-the-box solution.

## Getting Started

Next, we will provide two examples:

1.  [Generating a website and EPUB for novels](./book.md)
2.  [Generating a blog from notes](./blog.md)

Thanks to ChatGPT, mark-magic now has a mascot.

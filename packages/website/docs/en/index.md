## Introduction

A markdown-based data connection and conversion tool that solves data conversion between different tools and coordination between some commonly used tools.

Some use cases:

1.  Publishing notes online, such as generating content required for a hexo blog from the Joplin note tool and publishing it online at <https://blog.rxliuli.com/>.
2.  Publishing a novel online, such as generating a novel website from a local markdown file and publishing it at <https://tts.liuli.moe/>.
3.  Packaging a novel into an epub file, such as packaging "To the Stars" into an epub file for offline reading after downloading at <https://github.com/liuli-moe/to-the-stars/releases>.

Some previous community use cases:

1.  Joplin => Hugo for generating a blog.
2.  Joplin => Jekyll for generating a blog.
3.  Possibly others...

## Why not use existing tools

We have already used many tools for different tasks, but they are all based on markdown, such as:

- Using Joplin for note-taking
- Using Hexo for writing blogs
- Using Vitepress for generating documentation websites
- Using Docusaurus for generating SEO-friendly novel websites
- Using Pandoc for generating epubs

What really causes us pain is when using Docusaurus, each novel requires a bunch of configurations, which is very annoying. Therefore, we hope to have better out-of-the-box tools.

## Getting started

Below are two examples:

1.  [Generating a website and epub for a novel](./book.md)
2.  [Generating a blog from notes](./blog.md)

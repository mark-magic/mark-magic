## Introduction

A data connection and transformation tool based on Markdown, solving data conversion between different tools and coordinating between some commonly used tools.

Some use cases

1.  Publishing notes online, for example, generating content required by Hexo blog from Joplin note tool for publishing on the web <https://blog.rxliuli.com/>
2.  Publishing a novel online, for example, generating a novel website from local Markdown files for publication, <https://tts.liuli.moe/>
3.  Packaging a novel into an EPUB file, for example, packaging "To the Stars" into an EPUB for easy offline reading, <https://github.com/liuli-moe/to-the-stars/releases>

Some previous community use cases

1.  Joplin => Hugo to generate a blog
2.  Joplin => Jeykll to generate a blog
3.  There may be others...

## Why not use existing tools

I have already used many tools to handle different tasks, but they are all based on Markdown, such as

- Taking notes with Joplin
- Writing blogs with Hexo
- Generating documentation websites with Vitepress
- Generating SEO-friendly novel websites with Docusaurus
- Generating EPUB with Pandoc

What really annoys me is when using Docusaurus, each novel requires a lot of configuration, which is very annoying. So I hope to have a better out-of-the-box tool.

## Getting started

Next, two examples are provided

1.  [Generating a website and EPUB for a novel](./book.md)
2.  [Generating a blog from notes](./blog.md)

## Introduction

A markdown-based data connection and conversion tool to solve data conversion between different tools and coordination between some common tools.

Some use cases

1. Publish some notes online, for example, generate content required by hexo blog from joplin note tool and publish it online
2. Publish a novel online, for example, generate a novel website from local markdown files and publish it
3. Package a novel into an epub file, for example, package "Flying to the Stars" into an epub file for offline reading after downloading

Some use cases from the community

1. joplin => hugo generating a blog
2. joplin => jekyll generating a blog
3. There may be others...

## Why not use existing tools

We have now used many tools to handle different tasks, but they are all based on markdown, such as

- Use joplin to record notes
- Use hexo to write a blog
- Use vitepress to generate documentation websites
- Use docusaurus to generate SEO-friendly novel websites
- Use pandoc to generate epub

What really makes us feel painful is that when using docusaurus, each novel requires a lot of configuration, which is very annoying. So we hope to have better tools that can be used out of the box.

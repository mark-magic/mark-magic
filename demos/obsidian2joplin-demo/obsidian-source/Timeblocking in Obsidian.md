[Obsidian](https://thesweetsetup.com/obsidian/) is a great place to practice time blocking because you can link your time-blocked schedule to your daily note. In this video, we're going to walk you through how to set up time blocking in Obsidian using the _Daily Notes_ Core plugin, and the _Day Planner_ Community plugin.

The first thing you need to do is click the gear icon in the left sidebar to access the _Settings_.

Next, go to **Core Plugins** and make sure that the _Daily Notes_ plugin is enabled.

Once the _Daily Notes_ plugin is enabled, you'll see an additional icon in the left sidebar. Click on this icon to either create or open today's Daily Note. For example, this is the daily note for August 9, 2021.

This is a great place to capture any sort of information that we want to associate with today's date, including ideas with tasks that we need to do. It's also the perfect place to set our time blocked schedule using the _Day Planner_ plugin.

## Setting Up Day Planner

Go back to the Settings menu and click **Community Plugins**, then click **Browse**.

From the Community Plugins directory, search for _Day Planner_.

Click **Install** to install the plugin and **Enable** to turn it on.

Next, close the plugins directory. Go to installed plugins and make sure that the _Day Planner_ plugin is toggled on.

Now _Day Planner_ is ready to be used. By default, it keeps your day planner documents in a separate folder and we want to include these on our daily notes. So in the settings for the _Day Planner_ plugin, change _File Mode_ to _Command Mode_.

Here are the other recommended settings:

- Complete past planner items: ON
- Mermaid Gantt: OFF
- Status Bar - Circular Progress: ON
- Status Bar - Now & Next: ON
- Task Notification: OFF
- Task Zoom Level: LOW (all the way to the left)

Now we're ready to use the day planner plugin.

## Using Day Planner

Go back to our daily notes and insert a _Day Planner_ section by hitting `Command-P` to open up the _Command Palette_. Search for `Day Planner` and select the bottom option _Day Planner: Add a Day Planner template for today to the current note_.

Next, plan out your day using 24 hour time formatting like so:

```
- [ ] 07:00 Morning Routine
- [ ] 08:00 Meetings
- [ ] 10:00 TSS Admin
- [ ] 11:30 Weekly Standup
- [ ] 12:00 Lunch
- [ ] 13:00 Timeblocking Video
- [ ] 15:00 Writing
- [ ] 18:00 Soccer Practice
- [ ] 20:00 Dinner
```

In the Status Bar, we can see what we are working on right now: a circular chart indicating the progress of the current time block, and the next event on my time blocked plan.

We can also see a visualization of this by hitting `Command-P` to open up the _Command Palette_ again and searching for `Day Planner`, then selecting _Show the Day Planner Timeline_.

Once we do, the timeline opens in the right sidebar, giving us a visualization of our time blocked plan.

When we have _Track Current Time_ toggled on, the red bar will automatically adjust to the current time showing me only the appropriate information as we go about our day.

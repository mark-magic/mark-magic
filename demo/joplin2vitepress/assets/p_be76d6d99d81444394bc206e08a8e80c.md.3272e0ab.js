The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the application directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/#markdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Markdown format</a>. Joplin is available as a <strong>desktop</strong>, <strong>mobile</strong> and <strong>terminal</strong> application.</p><p>The notes in this notebook give an overview of what Joplin can do and how to use it. In general, the three applications share roughly the same functionalities; any differences will be clearly indicated.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""><a href="/demo/joplin2vitepress/p/2ba8366ac77c4a93b9eb7595d1343eb6.html">2.

In Markdown, links to these files are represented as an ID. In the note viewer, these files, if they are images, will be displayed or, if they are other files (PDF, text files, etc.) they will be displayed as links. Clicking on this link will open the file in the default application.</p><p>Images can be attached either by clicking on &quot;Attach file&quot; or by pasting (with <code>Ctrl+V</code> or <code>Cmd+V</code>) an image directly in the editor, or by drag and dropping an image.</p><p>More info about attachments: <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/#attachments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://joplinapp.org/help/#attachments</a></p><h2 id="search" tabindex="-1">Search <a class="header-anchor" href="#search" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Joplin supports advanced search queries, which are fully documented on the official website: <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/#searching" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://joplinapp.org/help/#searching</a></p><h2 id="alarms" tabindex="-1">Alarms <a class="header-anchor" href="#alarms" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>An alarm can be associated with any to-do.

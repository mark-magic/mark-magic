## Introduction

A data linking and conversion tool based on Markdown, solving data conversion between different tools and coordination between some common tools.

Some use cases include:

1. Publishing notes online, such as generating content required by the hexo blog from the joplin note tool and publishing it to the internet <https://blog.rxliuli.com/>
2. Publishing a novel online, such as generating a novel website from local markdown files for release, <https://tts.liuli.moe/>
3. Packaging a novel as an epub file, for example packaging To the Stars as an epub, making it is easy to read offline after downloading, <https://github.com/liuli-moe/to-the-stars/releases>

Some previous use cases from the community include:

1. joplin => hugo for generating a blog
2. joplin => jeykll for generating a blog
3. And possibly others...

## Why not use existing tools

I've already used many tools to handle different tasks, but they are all based on markdown, for example

- Using joplin to record notes
- Using hexo to write a blog
- Using vitepress to generate a documentation site
- Using docusaurus to generate an SEO-friendly novel website
- Using pandoc to generate epub

What really bothers me is when using docusaurus, each novel requires a bunch of configurations, which is very annoying. Therefore, I hope there is a better tool that can be used out of the box.

## Getting Started

Here are two examples:

1. [Generate websites and epub documents for novels](./book.md)
2. [Generating blogs from notes](./blog.md)
